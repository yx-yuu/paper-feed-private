Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture. Our work provides the foundational real-space evidence for altermagnetism, moving the field from theoretical and momentum-space probes to direct visual confirmation; thereby opening a path to explore how this unconventional magnetic order couples to and controls other quantum electronic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Upscaling from ab initio atomistic simulations to electrode scale: The case of manganese hexacyanoferrate, a cathode material for Na-ion batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24816</link><description>arXiv:2512.24816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SSCHA-based evolutionary crystal structure prediction at finite temperatures with account for quantum nuclear motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24849</link><description>arXiv:2512.24849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) at finite temperatures with quantum anharmonic effects remains challenging but very prominent in systems with lightweight atoms such as superconducting hydrides. In this work, we integrate machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) to enable evolutionary CSP on the quantum anharmonic free-energy landscape. Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project. We demonstrate that AL-MLIPs allow to correctly predict the experimentally known cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m phase as the most stable polymorph at 150 GPa but require corrections within the thermodynamic perturbation theory to get consistent results. The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP. The proposed approach extends the reach of CSP to systems where quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity dominate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Large language models and the entropy of English</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969</link><description>arXiv:2512.24969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of 3D Superconformal Ising Criticality on the Fuzzy Sphere</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25054</link><description>arXiv:2512.25054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link><description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link><description>arXiv:2512.23880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of First-Principles Methods in Modeling the Melting Properties of Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23940</link><description>arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Testing Noise Correlations by an AI-Assisted Two-Qubit Quantum Sensor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24135</link><description>arXiv:2512.24135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine learning-assisted protocol to classify time and space correlations of classical noise acting on a quantum system, using two interacting qubits as probe. We consider different classes of noise, according to their Markovianity and spatial correlations. Leveraging the sensitivity of a coherent population transfer protocol under three distinct driving conditions, the various noises are discriminated by only measuring the final transfer efficiencies. This approach reaches around 90% accuracy with a minimal experimental overhead.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24135v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24822</link><description>arXiv:2512.24822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic breaking of axial symmetry of acoustic waves in crystals as the origin of nonlinear elasticity and chaos: Analytical model and MD simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04175</link><description>arXiv:2510.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in orientated FCC crystals. A force of dynamic origin is found that is perpendicular to the direction of the external shear pressure. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in the motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic 3D potential for interaction between crystallographic layers. The potential is found to possess a component that has an anharmonic threefold axial symmetry around one direction. It reduces to the H{\'e}non-Heinen potential in a 2D cross-section, leading to mathematically rich, complex dynamic features. Results of simulation predict displacements of atoms that are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity that may have been overlooked in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link><description>arXiv:2510.18325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18325v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Phase Stability, Structural, Mechanical, Optoelectronic, and Thermoelectric Properties of the III-V Semiconductor AlSb for Energy Conversion Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22277</link><description>arXiv:2512.22277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22277v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614</link><description>arXiv:2508.16614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 8.78% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.21%) and MatterGen (3.66%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16614v3</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Challenges in Transitioning from Pellet to Practical Argyrodite-Based All-Solid-State Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368/asset/images/medium/nz5c03368_0004.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:54:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Hollow nanofiber ion conductor protective layer on Zn metal anode for long-term stable zinc battery</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25049953?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 146&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Mengfei Sun, Zumin Zhang, Yang Su, Wensheng Yu, Xiangting Dong, Dongtao Liu, Xinlu Wang, Gaopeng Li, Jinxian Wang&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:41:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25049953</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Alkaline-compatible polyaniline/graphene negative electrode for ultrahigh-energy all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25048844?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 146&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Aizhen Xu, Li Yin, Shaoqing Zhang, Zhiyi Zhao, Wenna Lv, Yuanyu Zhu, Yujun Qin&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:41:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25048844</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents] Machine Learning–Guided Solvation Engineering of Chiral Viologens for Durable Neutral Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202522442?af=R</link><description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:56:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/anie.202522442</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Scalable photonic reservoir computing for parallel machine learning tasks</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67983-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 31 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67983-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67983-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Neuromorphic computing processes data faster and with less energy than electronics.

We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry. These results enable the engineering and measurement of HBNs in confined environments with tailored acidity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Thiol-bearing tertiary alkylammonium chloride for regulation of PbI2 excess in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>One of the key strategies for record photovoltaic efficiencies in metal halide perovskite solar cells is the addition of PbI2 excess in a stoichiometric perovskite solution which controls crystallization, passivates defects and induces a preferred orientation in the perovskite layer. However, residual PbI2, typically found in the perovskite layer after crystallization, generates non-radiative recombination centres and promotes ion migration under light and heating stress, thus accelerating performance loss. To mitigate the above issues, a common strategy is the post-deposition of organic ammonium salts which interact in situ with residual PbI2. Here, we adopt a multifunctional alkylammonium salt, 2-diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride (DEAET), in which both the thiol (–SH) and protonated tertiary amine groups can strongly bind to PbI₂. Upon deposition of DEAET on top of FAPbI3 film, we show that DEAT decreases the percentage of residual PbI2 by 40% and totally eliminates Pb0. These two effects lead to enhanced radiative recombination, proving a net passivation effect, while chemical analysis (FTIR and liquid-state NMR) explains that this is due to strong interactions between tertiary protonated ammonium (-NH+) and thiol (-SH) groups of DEAT with under-coordinated Pb2+. The stabilization of FAPbI3 black phase along with the establishment of a solid barrier to impede the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite layer over time lead to enhanced operational stability for the as-fabricated solar cells. The encouraging findings of this study lay the foundation for the utilization of tertiary ammonium thiol-based salts as efficient agents for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] LAMMPS-ANI: Large Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations

The high diversity of the Aβ family provides a significant challenge for recognizing various Aβ forms, which may differ by a single amino acid or a post-translational modification. Such variation at the N-terminus of Aβ peptides leads to changes in their properties associated with typical AD biomolecular mechanisms, such as aggregation or generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, a novel method for discriminating Aβ peptides with physiologically occurring truncations and modifications at their N-termini, based on the electrochemical profiling of their Cu(II) complexes, is presented. A dual-electrode set-up incorporating both glassy carbon and gold electrodes, together with Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV), was employed to generate unique electrochemical profiles, which were subsequently analyzed using chemometric techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data exploration, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) for classification. By combining electrochemical measurements with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, we successfully differentiated the studied Aβ forms, Aβ1-16, Aβ3-16, Aβpyr3-16, Aβ4-16, Aβ5-16, Aβ11-16, and Aβpyr11-16. The integration of machine learning not only enhances detection accuracy but also identifies subtle patterns that could support early-stage diagnostics. These findings support the ongoing development of analytical strategies that seek to improve the detection range and accuracy of Aβ peptides identification in Alzheimer’s disease research.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Hierarchical optimization of perovskite solar cell fabrication via step-by-step machine learning</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00642-3?rss=yes</link><description>Pu et al. report a hierarchical multi-target Bayesian optimization (MTBO) framework that optimizes the electrospray deposition process for perovskite solar cells.

and conversion systems and have become a better choice to generate green hydrogen than their proton 
exchange membrane counterparts owing to the non-acidic working conditions as well as the use of nonprecious metal catalytic electrodes. Albeit the safe operating conditions as well as the use of non-precious 
metals, the ion conductivity and technology readiness level of AEMs are significantly lower than their PEM 
counterparts. It is well accepted that the key factors that drive their performance are anion conductivity, 
water uptake and chemical stability. However, there exist several other parameters that influence not 
only the KPI’s but also the overall electrochemical performance of AEMs. The objective of this study is to 
compile the various physical processes in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser and focus on 
the dominant ones that define the performance of these membranes. We further propose appropriate 
methods to predict the KPIs using multiscale approach. In this report, we elaborately discuss the abovementioned points with a note that, this area still requires substantial research and profound 
understanding from both experimental and computational point of view. In this article, a comprehensive 
review on molecular dynamics simulation methods for anion exchange membranes is extensively 
discussed. We also briefly touch upon the data analytics-based approaches to predict ion conductivity in these
membranes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5jcw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Materials Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Machine Learning Applications in Predicting Friction Properties of Bearing Steel: A Review</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.5c01047</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.5c01047/asset/images/medium/tz5c01047_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Materials Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialslett.5c01047&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Materials Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:59:57 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.5c01047</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Sterically Protected High Triplet Exciplex Hosts for Ultra-Bright Green OLEDs</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16369</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c16369/asset/images/medium/ja5c16369_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c16369&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:03:11 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16369</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia] Inverse Design of High-Performance Glasses Through an Encoder-Decoder Machine Learning Approach Toward Materials Discovery: Application to Oxynitride Glasses</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645425011693?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 29 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Acta Materialia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Alexis Duval, Eric Robin, Patrick Houizot, Tanguy Rouxel&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Acta Materialia</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:31:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645425011693</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Machine learning-aided prediction and optimization of specific capacitance in functionalized GO-based Mn/Fe co-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X25048285?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 146&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Vijay A.

Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22277v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Role of THz Phonons in the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ Polymorphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22427</link><description>arXiv:2512.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superionic conduction in solid-state materials is governed not only by static factors, such as structure and composition, but also by dynamic interactions between the mobile ion and the crystal lattice. Specifically, the dynamics of lattice vibrations, or phonons, have attracted interest because of their hypothesized ability to facilitate superionic conduction. However, direct experimental measurement of the role of phonons in ionic conduction is challenging due to the fast intrinsic timescales of ion hopping and the difficulty of driving relevant phonon modes, which often lie in the low-energy THz regime. To overcome these limitations, we use laser-driven ultrafast impedance spectroscopy (LUIS). LUIS resonantly excites phonons using a THz field and probes ion hopping with picosecond time resolution. We apply LUIS to understand the dynamical role of phonons in $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ (LLZO). When in its cubic phase (c-LLZO), this garnet-type solid electrolyte has an ionic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than its tetragonal phase (t-LLZO). T-LLZO is characterized by an ordered and filled $Li^+$ sublattice necessitating synchronous ion hopping. In contrast, c-LLZO is characterized by a disordered and vacancy-rich $Li^+$ sublattice, and has a conduction mechanism dominated by single hops. We find that, upon excitation of phonons in the 0.5-7.5 THz range, the impedance of t-LLZO experiences a longer ion hopping decay signal in comparison to c-LLZO. The results suggest that phonon-mediated ionic conduction by THz modes may lead to larger ion displacements in ordered and fully occupied mobile ion sublattices as opposed to those that are disordered and vacancy-rich. Overall, this work highlights the interplay between static and dynamic factors that enables improved ionic conductivity in otherwise poorly conducting inorganic solids.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermally Activated Non-Affine Rearrangements in Amorphous Glass: Emergence of Intrinsic Length Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22530</link><description>arXiv:2512.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of temperature-driven nonaffine rearrangements in a model amorphous solid across the full thermodynamic range, from a high-temperature liquid, through supercooled and sub-glass regimes, into deep glassy states. The central result is a quantitative characterisation of the componentwise nonaffine residual displacements, obtained by subtracting local affine maps from particle displacements. For each state point the tails of the probability distributions of these nonaffine components display clear exponential decay; linear fits to the logarithm of the tail region yield characteristic nonaffine length scales {\xi}NA,x and {\xi}NA,y , which quantify the spatial extent of purely nonaffine, local rearrangements. To compare with other length scales, we compute van Hove distributions Gx(ux), Gy (uy ) which capture the full particle displacement field (coherent affine-like motion plus residuals). A robust, key finding is that the van Hove length scale consistently exceeds the filtered nonaffine length scale, i.e. {\xi}VH &gt; {\xi}NA, across all temperatures, state points, and densities we studied. The nonaffine length {\xi}NA quantifies the distance over which complex deformation occurs, specifically nonlinear and anharmonic responses, irreversible (plastic) rearrangements, topological non-recoverable particle rearrangements, and other residual motions that cannot be represented by a local affine map. Moreover, near equality of {\xi}NA,x and {\xi}NA,y in all conditions provides further evidence that nonaffine rearrangements propagate isotropically under thermally driven deformation in contrast to externally driven shear.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22530v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fast and accurate Fe-H machine-learning interatomic potential for elucidating hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22934</link><description>arXiv:2512.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22934v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Simple and Efficient Non-DFT-Based Machine Learning Interatomic Potential to Simulate Titanium MXenes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23063</link><description>arXiv:2512.23063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23063v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phosphorus-based lubricant additives on iron with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23583</link><description>arXiv:2512.23583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus-based lubricant additives are used for protecting metallic contacts under boundary lubrication by forming surface films that reduce wear and friction. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23583v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Expert-Grounded Automatic Prompt Engineering for Extracting Lattice Constants of High-Entropy Alloys from Scientific Publications using Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22130</link><description>arXiv:2512.22130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for scientific data extraction from publications, but rely on manual prompt refinement. We present an expert-grounded automatic prompt optimization framework that enhances LLM entity extraction reliability. Using high-entropy alloy lattice constant extraction as a testbed, we optimized prompts for Claude 3.5 Sonnet through feedback cycles on seven expert-annotated publications. Despite a modest optimization budget, recall improved from 0.27 to &gt; 0.9, demonstrating that a small, expert-curated dataset can yield significant improvements. The approach was applied to extract lattice constants from 2,267 publications, yielding data for 1,861 compositions. The optimized prompt transferred effectively to newer models: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash. Analysis revealed three categories of LLM mistakes: contextual hallucination, semantic misinterpretation, and unit conversion errors, emphasizing the need for validation protocols. These results establish feedback-guided prompt optimization as a low-cost, transferable methodology for reliable scientific data extraction, providing a scalable pathway for complex LLM-assisted research tasks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22130v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] HalluMat: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Materials Science Content Through Multi-Stage Verification</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22396</link><description>arXiv:2512.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22396v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multi-AI Agent Framework Reveals the "Oxide Gatekeeper" in Aluminum Nanoparticle Oxidation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22529</link><description>arXiv:2512.22529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (&lt; 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22529v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent democratizes access to state-of-the-art computational methodologies, accelerating hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Uniqueness of Replica-symmetric Saddle Point for Ising Perceptron</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23195</link><description>arXiv:2512.23195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the replica-symmetric saddle point equations for the Ising perceptron with Gaussian disorder and margin $\kappa\ge 0$. We prove that for each $\kappa\ge 0$ there is a critical capacity $\alpha_c(\kappa)=\frac{2}{\pi\,\mathbb E[(\kappa-Z)_+^2]}$, where $Z$ is a standard normal and $(x)_+=\max\{x,0\}$, such that the saddle point equation has a unique solution for $\alpha\in(0,\alpha_c(\kappa))$ and has no solution when $\alpha\ge \alpha_c(\kappa)$. When $\alpha\uparrow \alpha_c(\kappa)$ and $\kappa&gt;0$, the replica-symmetric free energy at this solution diverges to $-\infty$. In the zero-margin case $\kappa=0$, Ding and Sun obtained a conditional uniqueness result, with one step verified numerically. Our argument gives a fully analytic proof without computer assistance. We used GPT-5 to help develop intermediate proof steps and to perform sanity-check computations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23195v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SimplySQS: An Automated and Reproducible Workflow for Special Quasirandom Structure Generation with ATAT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18020</link><description>arXiv:2510.18020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is widely used for modeling disordered materials under periodic boundary conditions, with the ATAT mcsqs module being one of the most established implementations. However, SQS generation with mcsqs typically relies on manual preparation of input files, ad hoc execution scripts, and post-processing steps, which introduces user-dependent errors and limits reproducibility. Here, we present SimplySQS (https://simplysqs.com), an automated and reproducible workflow for SQS generation that is delivered through an online, interactive interface. SimplySQS guides users through structure import, compositional and supercell definition, and cluster parameter selection, while automatically generates all required ATAT input files and a single all-in-one execution script that encapsulates the complete search process. By standardizing input preparation, execution, and output analysis, the framework minimizes errors associated with manual file handling and enables consistent reproducibility of SQS searches. The workflow is demonstrated on the Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3 (STO)) perovskite system. SQSs spanning the entire concentration range were generated using a single automated bash script produced by SimplySQS, after which all resulting structures were subjected to geometry optimization using a universal machine-learning interatomic potential (MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0). This approach reliably reproduced the experimentally observed cubic-to-tetragonal transition near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic region (x &gt; 0.5) and less than 4 % in the tetragonal region (x &lt; 0.5). Overall, SimplySQS transforms SQS generation with ATAT into intuitive, reproducible, and systematic framework for modeling disordered materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18020v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials on Elemental Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20230</link><description>arXiv:2512.20230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20230v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link><description>arXiv:2512.21049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like oscillatory statistics can also arise from a purely local dynamical mechanism, revealed using a minimal Lorenz model description of a walking droplet viewed as an active particle with internal degrees of freedom. A localized defect directly perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This work opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs by revealing how quantum-like statistics can emerge from local internal-state dynamics of active particles.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21049v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05973</link><description>arXiv:2512.05973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to find reliable and efficient numerical approximation schemes, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of one-particle irreducible two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. Based on this reformulation and reinterpretation we adopt a numerical scheme for the solution of field-dependent flow equations as nonlinear partial differential equations. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more interesting problems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05973v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Probabilistic Forecasting for Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vn440?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Coarse-grained molecular dynamics enables access to long length and time scales but often fails to reproduce atomistic kinetics when memory effects and slow collective motions are important. We introduce Probabilistic Forecasting for Coarse-Graining (PFCG), a machine learning framework that learns stochastic coarse-grained equations of motion directly from atomistic trajectories by formulating coarse-grained simulation as a probabilistic time-series forecasting problem with both Markovian and non-Markovian contributions. PFCG incorporates non-Markovian effects through finite trajectory history without requiring explicit memory kernels or learned effective potentials. We apply PFCG to miniproteins and polyalanine peptides and evaluate both configurational and dynamical fidelity using free energy surfaces, autocorrelation functions, and transition timescales from Markov state models. Across all systems, non-Markovian PFCG models significantly improve dynamical agreement with atomistic simulation relative to Markovian baselines while also maintaining excellent agreement with stationary distributions. These results highlight the importance of inductive biases at the level of equations of motion and establish PFCG as a complementary approach to existing machine learning-based coarse-graining methods for modeling biomolecular processes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-vn440?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Toward high entropy material discovery for energy applications using computational and machine learning methods</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01918-6</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 30 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01918-6"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-025-01918-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Toward high entropy material discovery for energy applications using computational and machine learning methods</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01918-6</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Augmenting Large Language Models for Automated Discovery of f-Element Extractants</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Efficient separation of f-elements is a critical challenge for a wide range of emerging technologies. The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to propose new ligands and preliminarily rank their performance using a supervised machine learning model trained on experimental datasets to consider the impact of realistic experimental conditions. Promising human-approved ligands are then passed to a second automated pipeline that constructs three-dimensional metal-ligand complexes and performs quantum mechanical free energy calculations to directly assess metal selectivity. We demonstrate this approach for Am(III)/Eu(III) separations and report several newly designed ligands predicted to exhibit higher Am(III)/Eu(III) selectivity than the benchmark extractant CyMe4BTBP. This workflow accelerates computational exploration of the molecular space in this data-sparse field and provides a general strategy for the rapid generation and evaluation of novel lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) extractants.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Hybrid ChemBERTa and DFT Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Enantioselectivity in Organosilanes Mediated Carbonyl Reduction Reactions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zhr57?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Predicting the small yet meaningful enantioselectivity differences in organosilanes mediated carbonyl reductions remains challenging because multiple steric, electronic and conformational factors interact in ways that traditional mechanistic rules struggle to describe.

In this work, the phonon dynamics, carrier transport, and TE performance of the layered SmZnSbO compound are comprehensively evaluated using first-principles calculations, machine learning interatomic potentials, Boltzmann transport theory, and the two-channel model. The coexistence of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, robust intralayer covalent bonding interactions, and rattling-like vibrations of Zn atoms synergistically induces significant lattice anharmonicity, resulting in a decreased lattice thermal conductivity (0.84 W/mK@900 K within the framework of the two-channel model) for the SmZnSbO compound. The natural quantum well architecture formed by the alternative conductive [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; layer and the insulated [Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; layer endows quasi-two-dimensional transport characteristics, enabling a high carrier mobility of 34.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs. Moreover, the multi-valley electronic band structure with an indirect bandgap of 0.80 eV simultaneously optimizes electrical conductivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;) and Seebeck coefficient (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;), resulting in an enhanced power factor.

Routine alcohol-based cleaning can be impractical on high-touch optical surfaces due to damage risk and usability concerns. Here, we present a scalable approach to transparent, mechanically robust glass surfaces by embedding materials with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ad hoc&lt;/span&gt; functionality into surface glass nanoholes. We demonstrate the concept with copper nanodisks: copper is an established antimicrobial agent, but its wear susceptibility pose challenges for use on transparent displays. Our design shields the functional material from lateral wear while allowing ion diffusion for antimicrobial efficacy. Fabrication uses only wafer-compatible, lithography-free steps: thermal dewetting of a thin silver film to create a nanosized mask; inverting it to a polymer nanoholes mask by etching the silver nanoparticles; wet etching of the glass to form nanoholes; selective copper deposition inside these holes; and liftoff of excess material. The resulting surfaces exhibit mean transmission of 80%–85% in the 380–750 nm range with haze &amp;lt;1% and minimal color shift, compared to uncoated glass.

Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles from fluids is essential to ensure a safe global supply of drinking water yet, in the case of microscopic particles, it remains a highly energy-intensive process when using traditional filtration methods. Water cleaning through diffusiophoresis $\unicode{x2014}$spontaneous colloid migration in chemical gradients$\unicode{x2014}$ effectively circumvents the need for physical filters, representing a promising alternative. This separation process is typically realized in internal flows where a cross-channel electrolyte gradient drives particle accumulation at walls, with colloid separation slowly increasing in the streamwise direction. However, the maximum separation efficiency, achieved sufficiently downstream as diffusiophoretic migration (driving particle accumulation) is balanced by Brownian motion (inducing diffusive spreading), has not yet been characterized. In this work, we develop a theory to predict this upper bound, and derive the colloid separation efficiency by analyzing the asymptotic structure of the governing equations. We find that the mechanism by which the chemical permeates in the channel, as well as the reaction kinetics governing its dissociation into ions, play key roles in the process. Moreover, we identify four distinct regimes in which separation is controlled by different scaling laws involving a Damk\"ohler and a P\'eclet number, which measure the ratio of reaction kinetics to ion diffusion and of diffusiophoresis to Brownian motion, respectively. We also confirm the scaling of one of these regimes using microfluidic experiments where separation is driven by CO$_\text{2}$ gradients. Our results shed light on pathways towards new, more efficient separations, and are also applicable to quantify colloidal accumulation in the presence of chemical gradients in more general situations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21758v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature- and Pressure-Dependent Vibrational Properties and Phase Stability of Pristine and Sb-Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21810</link><description>arXiv:2512.21810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulating these properties remains poorly understood. We investigate Sb-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4 to 273 K), high-pressure studies (0 to 30 GPa), powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping dramatically improves phase purity, eliminating all impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine and Bi-doped samples while retaining only the three fundamental [TiCl$_6$]$^{2-}$ octahedral vibrations. This enhanced purity reveals a previously unobserved structural phenomenon: Sb-doped samples (2\% doped and 3\%) incorporated) exhibit a sharp anomaly at 100 K marked by the emergence of a new Raman mode M$_1$ at 314--319 cm$^{-1}$ and abrupt changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ (factor of 2--8$\times$ change) and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. No such transition occurs in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, indicating Sb-dopant-induced order-disorder transformation. The enhanced phonon anharmonicity in Sb-doped samples directly manifests in photoluminescence: self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm shows 19\% broader FWHM (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), confirming stronger electron-phonon coupling. High-pressure measurements reveal structural robustness to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These findings establish that strategic Sb doping not only improves material quality but also enables a novel low-temperature structural transition, providing fundamental insights into dopant-mediated phase control in vacancy-ordered perovskites for next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Incorporating rank-free coupling and external field via an amplitude-only modulated spatial photonic Ising machine</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21587</link><description>arXiv:2512.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as effective solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, such as NP-hard problems, machine learning, and financial modeling. Recent spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) excel in multi-node optimization and spin glass simulations, leveraging their large-scale and fully connected characteristics. However, existing laser diffraction-based SPIMs usually sacrifice time efficiency or spin count to encode high-rank spin-spin coupling and external fields, limiting their scalability for real-world applications. Here, we demonstrate an amplitude-only modulated rank-free spatial photonic Ising machine (AR-SPIM) with 200 iterations per second. By re-formulating an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian as the sum of Hadamard products, followed by loading the corresponding matrices/vectors onto an aligned amplitude spatial light modulator and digital micro-mirrors device, we directly map a 797-spin Ising model with external fields (nearly 9-bit precision, -255 to 255) into an incoherent light field, eliminating the need for repeated and auxiliary operations. Serving as encoding accuracy metrics, the linear coefficient of determination and Pearson correlation coefficient between measured light intensities and Ising Hamiltonians exceed 0.9800, with values exceed 0.9997 globally. The AR-SPIM achieves less than 0.3% error rate for ground-state search of biased Max-cut problems with arbitrary ranks and weights, enables complex phase transition observations, and facilitates scalable spin counts for sparse Ising problems via removing zero-valued Hadamard product terms. This reconfigurable AR-SPIM can be further developed to support large-scale machine-learning training and deployed for practical applications in discrete optimization and quantum many-body simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21587v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Autonomous Goal-evolving Agents</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21782</link><description>arXiv:2512.21782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21782v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlated Terahertz phonon-ion interactions control ion conduction in a solid electrolyte</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01632</link><description>arXiv:2305.01632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve coupled phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of coupled phonon-ion hopping modes which enhance Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes greatly increases the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of vibrational modes associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving TiO6 rocking modes via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the differential impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons. Additionally, we differentiate the ultrafast responses of LLTO due to ultrafast heating and THz-range vibrations using laser-driven spectroscopy (LUIS), finding a unique long-lived response for the THz-range excitation. These findings provide new insights into coupled ion migration mechanisms, indicating the important role of THz-range coupled phonon-ion hopping modes in enabling fast ion conduction at room temperature.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2305.01632v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fluctuation theorems with optical tweezers: theory and practice</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20894</link><description>arXiv:2503.20894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems, such as the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation, are effective tools connecting non-equilibrium work statistics and equilibrium free energy differences. However, detailed hands-on, reproducible protocols for implementing and analyzing these relations in real experiments remain scarce. This tutorial provides an end-to-end workflow for measuring, validating, and applying fluctuation theorems using a single-beam optical tweezers setup. It introduces the foundational ideas and consolidates practical calibration (PSD-based trap stiffness and position sensitivity), protocol design (forward/reverse finite-time drives over multiple amplitudes and durations), and robust estimators for free-energy difference and dissipated work, highlighting finite-sampling and rare-event effects. We demonstrate the procedures using an extensive set of measured trajectories under different conditions and provide openly accessible datasets and Python code, enabling new researchers or educators to reproduce the results with minimal effort. Beyond pedagogical validation, we discuss how these recipes translate to broader soft-matter and mesoscopic contexts. By combining user-friendly instruments with clear and transparent analysis, this work promotes the education and reliable adoption of stochastic thermodynamic methods in the curricula of physics and chemistry, as well as among emerging research teams.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.20894v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Rewards-based image analysis in microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18522</link><description>arXiv:2502.18522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging and hyperspectral data analysis is central to progress across biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The core challenge lies in converting high-resolution or high-dimensional datasets into interpretable representations that enable insight into the underlying physical or chemical properties of a system. Traditional analysis relies on expert-designed, multistep workflows, such as denoising, feature extraction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolution, or on machine learning (ML) methods that accelerate individual steps. Both approaches, however, typically demand significant human intervention, including hyperparameter tuning and data labeling. Achieving the next level of autonomy in scientific imaging requires designing effective reward-based workflows that guide algorithms toward best data representation for human or automated decision-making. Here, we discuss recent advances in reward-based workflows for image analysis, which capture key elements of human reasoning and exhibit strong transferability across various tasks. We highlight how reward-driven approaches enable a shift from supervised black-box models toward explainable, unsupervised optimization on the examples of Scanning Probe and Electron Microscopies. Such reward-based frameworks are promising for a broad range of applications, including classification, regression, structure-property mapping, and general hyperspectral data processing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.18522v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Protocol to Identify Large Language Model Use in Undergraduate Chemistry Essays</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cz9pc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Large language modules (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT have been widely adopted by chemistry undergraduate university students as a learning tool, but few methods exist to measure the scope of their influence on essay writing.

When the lists of key words were applied to specific essays, the findings indicated 13-29% of essays submitted during 2025 relied heavily on text generated by LLMs.  This protocol offers a simple method to generate an approximate scope of LLM uptake amongst a cohort, with potential applications in defining higher education AI policy and assessment strategies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cz9pc?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Graph machine learning can estimate drug concentrations in whole blood from forensic screening results</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-lllcx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>LC-HRMS is widely used in forensic toxicology for broad-scope screening. When a newly emerging or rarely encountered compound is tentatively identified, toxicologists must decide whether it may be relevant to the case and, if so, quantify it. Acquiring reference material for quantification is costly and time-consuming. A fast semi-quantitative estimate would help prioritize only compounds above the toxic threshold. This study presents a machine-learning framework that estimates drug concentrations in whole blood using molecular structure information and LC-HRMS signal intensities. Using a dataset of 191 drugs spiked into whole blood at multiple concentration levels, we trained and evaluated several machine-learning models. Standard models, including random forests, achieved moderate performance. In contrast, a recently published graph neural network (GNN) leveraging atomic features and global molecular properties consistently produced the highest accuracy. Under cross-validation, the GNN predicted signal-to-concentration ratio for 79\% of all molecules, corresponding to concentration estimates between 50-200\% of true value. Toxicological thresholds often span multiple orders of magnitude, making this precision acceptable for application. The GNN model was additionally evaluated on an external benchmark dataset of ionization efficiencies (logIE), where it outperformed the current state of the art. Overall, the results demonstrate the feasibility of using graph-based machine learning to estimate drug concentrations in whole blood without reference material for prioritization. This is a practical and implementation-ready machine learning tool that can support decision-making in toxicological evaluation, particularly for newly emerging or rarely encountered drugs. The GNN model is open source and the dataset used for training and testing the models is publicly available.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-lllcx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Confidently uncertain: Probabilistic machine learning to predict soil biotransformation half-lives</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xmslf?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Predicting environmental persistence of chemicals from molecular structure is an open challenge, yet indispensable in regulatory screenings for potentially harmful substances and to advance the development of safe-and-sustainable-by-design chemicals. Limited availability of biotransformation half-life data makes persistence prediction difficult, and models typically struggle to generalize beyond their training data. Therefore, reliable estimates of prediction confidence are key.  Here, we propose a probabilistic model for the prediction of soil biotransformation half-lives. A Gaussian Process Regressor was trained on 867 mean pesticide half-lives with data uncertainty estimates. Instead of single half-life values, our model predicts well-calibrated probability distributions that can be used to calculate a compound's probability of being persistent. Although the overall model performance remains moderate, the predictions are reliable when the confidence in the prediction is high.  We applied our model to pesticide transformation products with unknown half-lives, and to a database of globally marketed chemicals. We show that our model is able to identify chemicals that are known, or suspected to be, persistent in the environment. The model is available as an online app (https://pepper-app.streamlit.app/) and as a Python library (pepper-lab) to meet diverse user needs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xmslf?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Characterizing PEDOT:PSS for Electronic Control of Stiffness</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1qw4z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Active stiffness, the changing of material stiffness in response to an external stimulus, can be harnessed for mechanically adaptive implantable devices and dynamic cell culture substrates for mechanobiology investigations. Conducting polymer (CP)-based materials are capable of changing stiffness in response to an applied electrical potential: redox-driven changes in charge state lead to ion transport and subsequent swelling. However, conducting polymers have seldom been investigated for this purpose. In this study, the stiffness of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films as a function of applied potential is characterized. Electrochemical preconditioning is first defined and the proportionality of ion transport to voltage is identified. The maximum stiffness change observed over the potential range was found to be ~32.5% and changes of ~6.7-10.4% were found with 0.2 V increments. PEDOT:PSS films deviate in both their charge state and stiffness over a period of many hours after unbiasing. After unbiasing, PEDOT:PSS loses the transported charge over time and the stiffness changes by ~2.6-15.2% over 24 hrs. Finally, to evaluate feasibility for biomedical applications, assays involving active stiffness modulation determine that the process is cytocompatible. These characterizations highlight both the potential of CPs for active stiffness and identify areas for future optimization.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1qw4z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] River plastic hotspot detection from space</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02831-7?rss=yes</link><description>Plastic pollution threatens terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and rivers play a central role in transporting and retaining plastics across landscapes.

Patients were divided into training (n=202), test (n=33), and external validation sets (n=53, n=42). Using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, 38 variables were analyzed to develop six machine learning models.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] ChemTSv3: Generalizing Molecular Design via Flexible Search Space Control</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kdvrt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled in silico molecular design to become a powerful approach for exploring chemical space toward specific design goals across various domains. However, in actual design workflows, determining the appropriate generation conditions, including generative strategies and reward formulations, remains difficult; thus, trial-and-error adjustments are unavoidable. Yet, most existing generation methods implicitly fix the searchable chemical space defined by the molecular representation and generation method, which significantly limits the flexibility of practical design.  This paper introduces ChemTSv3, an exploration framework based on reinforcement learning with a flexible architecture that accommodates diverse design scenarios for adaptive molecular design.  Specifically, molecular representations are unified as nodes, enabling, for example, string-based encodings, molecular graphs, and protein sequences to be handled within the same logic.  Molecular generations and editing operations are abstracted as transitions between nodes, allowing classical graph-based modifications, sequential mutations, and even large-language-model-driven transformations to be handled within the same formulation. ChemTSv3 supports dynamic switching among molecular representations and transition types, which enables the search strategy itself to adapt to the stage and nature of the design task.   ChemTSv3 enables scalable molecular generation, from drug-like small molecules to proteins, and its switching capability supports realistic change in design scenarios while allowing efficient exploration.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-kdvrt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine learning the quantum topology of chemical bonds</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zljl9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The chemical bonding can be characterized within quantum chemical topology (QCT), which provides a real-space description via the topological analysis of the electron density and the electron localization function (ELF). While QCT has traditionally been applied on a molecule-by-molecule basis, recent advances in machine learning (ML) and the availability of large quantum chemical datasets now enable bonding analysis at scale. Here, we integrate ELF-based topological descriptors with ML to establish a data-driven framework for mapping chemical bonding across the QM9 dataset. Wavefunctions computed at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level were used to extract ELF basin populations, which were paired with geometric and bonding descriptors to construct a bond-level dataset. Statistical analysis revealed relationships between ELF populations, bond lengths, and local chemical environments. Regression models were trained to predict ELF electron populations directly from molecular geometry. The best performance was obtained when local environmental descriptors were included, reducing the prediction error by a factor of two relative to models using only bond type and bond length. These results demonstrate real-space bonding parameters, such as bond electron populations, can be predicted from simple structural features, enabling scalable and interpretable exploration of chemical bonding across large chemical spaces.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zljl9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] StereoMolGraph: Stereochemistry-Aware Molecular and Reaction Graphs</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0g4wn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Conventional molecular graphs often are unable to reliably encode stereochemistry, especially for symmetric molecules, non-tetrahedral centers, and transition states. To overcome this, we present StereoMolGraph, an open source Python library implementing a stereochemistry-aware graph representation for molecules and condensed graphs of reactions. Our method uses permutation invariant local stereodescriptors, grounded in group theory, to provide an extensible representation of chirality. Based on this we introduce methods allowingfor robust comparison of stereoisomers, including the identification of enantiomerism and diastereomerism, and supports the of fleeting stereochemistry in transition states. We demonstrate the library’s utility for complex organic molecules and metal complexes and analysis of distinct chiral reaction pathways. With RDKit interoperability and visualization features, StereoMolGraph offers a practical and transparent tool for advanced stereochemically aware chemoinformatics workflows.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0g4wn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] GPU-Accelerated Analytic Coulomb- and Exchange Gradients for Hartree Fock and Density Functional Theory</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-tt68b?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We present a GPU-accelerated software package for the evaluation of analytic two-electron energy and gradient contributions in Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density Functional theory (DFT) calculations. The implementation is provided as a Python library with a C++ backend, enabling straightforward integration into modern computational chemistry and drug-discovery workflows. The code supports single-point energy and nuclear gradient evaluations on both single- and multi-GPU systems, and employs MPI-based parallelization with dynamic load balancing in multi-node environments.  
We report comprehensive benchmarks demonstrating favorable scaling with respect to system size, as well as high throughput for batched evaluations relevant to molecular dynamics, geometry optimization, and large-scale virtual screening. Parallel execution of a single system was carried out on up to 24 A100 GPUs. The implementation builds on optimized GPU-enabled variants of the LibintX and GauXC libraries to efficiently compute density-fitted Coulomb, semi-numerical exchange, and exchange--correlation

Abstract: Simulations of SiC crystal growth using molecular dynamics (MD) have become popular in recent years. They, however, simulate very fast deposition rates, to reduce computational costs. Therefore, they are more akin to surface sputtering, leading to abnormal growth effects, including thick amorphous layers and large defect densities. A recently developed method, called the minimum energy atomic deposition (MEAD), tries to overcome this problem by depositing the atoms directly at the minimum energy positions, increasing the time scale.
  We apply the MEAD method to simulate SiC crystal growth on stepped C-terminated 4H substrates with 4{\deg} and 8{\deg} off-cut angle. We explore relevant calculations settings, such as amount of equilibration steps between depositions and influence of simulation cell sizes and bench mark different interatomic potentials. The carefully calibrated methodology is able to replicate the stable step-flow growth, which was so far not possible using conventional MD simulations. Furthermore, the simulated crystals are evaluated in terms of their dislocations, surface roughness and atom mobility. Our methodology paves the way for future high fidelity investigations of surface phenomena in crystal growth.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20804v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link><description>arXiv:2512.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering experiments through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like statistics can also arise from a purely local, dynamical mechanism, which we elucidate using a minimal Lorenz-like model of a walking droplet. In this model, a localized defect perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This attractor-driven, local mechanism opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs based on active particles with internal degrees of freedom.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21049v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] From cluster to nanocrystal: the continuous evolution and critical size of copper clusters revealed by machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21067</link><description>arXiv:2512.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of cluster structure with size and the critical size for the transition from cluster to nanocrystal have long been fundamental problems in nanoscience. Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 &lt;= N &lt;= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N &lt; 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N &gt; 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 &lt;= N &lt;= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter). Our work terminates the long-term challenge in nanoscience, and lay the methodological foundation for subsequent research on other cluster systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active Learning Guided Computational Discovery of 2D Materials with Large Spin Hall Conductivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21077</link><description>arXiv:2512.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices due to their tunable properties and potential for efficient spin-charge interconversion. However, discovering materials with intrinsically high spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is hindered by the vast chemical space and expensive nature of conventional experimental and first-principles methods. In this work, we employ an active learning framework to accelerate the discovery of high-SHC 2D materials. Machine learning (ML) models were trained on SHC values computed from density functional theory calculations, incorporating the Kubo formalism via tight-binding Hamiltonians constructed from maximally localized Wannier functions, with explicit treatment of spin-orbit coupling. Starting from random but chemically diverse 24 2D systems, the dataset was expanded to 41 cases (from an overall pool of around 2000 materials) over three active learning loops using an expected improvement acquisition strategy. The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21077v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20785</link><description>arXiv:2512.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20785v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231</link><description>arXiv:2512.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21231v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13484</link><description>arXiv:2508.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work (Islam et al., 2025) showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. The simulations employ systems containing 2.4 million atoms and utilize a machine learning interatomic potential optimized to capture chemical complexity through the motif-based sampling technique. Using information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with processing parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13484v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Moir\'e spintronics: Emergent phenomena, material realization and machine learning accelerating discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04045</link><description>arXiv:2509.04045v2 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: Enhancing the kinetic stability of glasses often necessitates deepening thermodynamic stability, which typically compromises ductility due to increased structural rigidity. Decoupling these properties remains a critical challenge for functional applications. Here, we demonstrate that pattern engineering in metallic glasses (MGs) enables unprecedented kinetic ultrastability while retaining thermodynamic metastability and intrinsic plasticity. Through atomistic simulations guided by machine-learning interatomic potentials and replica-exchange molecular dynamics, we reveal that clustering oxygen contents, driven by reaction-diffusion-coupled pattern dynamics, act as localized pinning sites. These motifs drastically slow structural relaxation, yielding kinetic stability comparable to crystal-like ultrastable glasses while retaining an energetic as-cast state. Remarkably, the thermodynamically metastable state preserves heterogeneous atomic mobility, allowing strain delocalization under mechanical stress. By tailoring oxygen modulation via geometric patterning, we achieve an approximately 200 K increase in the onset temperature of the glass transition (Tonset) while maintaining fracture toughness akin to conventional MGs. This work establishes a paradigm of kinetic stabilization without thermodynamic compromise, offering a roadmap to additively manufacture bulk amorphous materials with combined hyperstability and plasticity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Composition-Based Machine Learning for Screening Superconducting Ternary Hydrides from a Curated Dataset</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20228</link><description>arXiv:2512.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ensemble machine-learning approach for composition-based, structure-agnostic screening of candidate superconductors among ternary hydrides under high pressure. Hydrogen-rich hydrides are known to exhibit high superconducting transition temperatures, and ternary or multinary hydrides can stabilize superconducting phases at reduced pressures through chemical compression. To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of ensemble-based machine learning as a primary screening tool for identifying promising regions of chemical space in superconducting hydrides.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Elemental Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20230</link><description>arXiv:2512.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (uMLIPs) has transformed materials modeling. However, a comprehensive understanding of their generalization behavior across configurational space remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate both the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium performance of state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including three MACE-based models, MatterSim, and PET-MAD. Our assessment utilizes Equation-of-State (EOS) tests to evaluate near-equilibrium properties, such as bulk moduli and equilibrium volumes, alongside extensive Minima Hopping (MH) structural searches to probe the global Potential Energy Surface (PES). Here, we assess universality within the fundamental limit of unary (elemental) systems, which serve as a necessary baseline for broader chemical generalization and provide a framework that can be systematically extended to multicomponent materials. We find that while most models exhibit high accuracy in reproducing equilibrium volumes for transition metals, significant performance gaps emerge in alkali and alkaline earth metal groups. Crucially, our MH results reveal a decoupling between search efficiency and structural fidelity, highlighting that smoother learned PESs do not necessarily yield more accurate energetic landscapes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20230v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Iterative learning scheme for crystal structure prediction with anharmonic lattice dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20424</link><description>arXiv:2512.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Fundamentals of quantum Boltzmann machine learning with visible and hidden units</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19819</link><description>arXiv:2512.19819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19819v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link><description>arXiv:2506.10965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported by F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble or Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, F. Xu et al. report that the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose and substantiate with analysis of the experimental data that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi-surface topology and a metallic phase with a non quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10965v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link><description>arXiv:2507.09001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic structure underpins advances in chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the development of powerful surrogate models that can enable the prediction of the ground state electron density and related properties at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional first principles simulations. Such ML models typically rely on massive datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculations. A key reason for relying on such large datasets is the lack of prior knowledge about which portions of the data are essential, and which are redundant. This study reveals significant redundancies in electronic structure datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and chemically complex alloys -- challenging the notion that extensive datasets are essential for accurate ML-based electronic structure predictions. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy that selects data across all learning difficulties, retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data, while reducing training time by threefold or greater. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate easy-to-learn data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors due to significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.09001v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Domain Wall-mediated Interfacial Ferroelectric Switching</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11997</link><description>arXiv:2508.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have demonstrated the importance of domain wall in polarization switching, the coexistence of various domain wall types and their impact on polarization stability lacks fundamental understanding. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls connect opposite polarization states and respond to out-of-plane electric field through polarization vector deviation, leading to inhomogeneous interlayer sliding and domain-wall migration. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, which are supported by our experimental observations.

The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06459v4</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: eScience] Achieving high-voltage polymer-based all-solid-state batteries based on thermodynamic and kinetic degradation insights</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725000631?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; eScience, Volume 6, Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Xiaoyan Yu, Yun Su, Hang Su, Ruizhi Liu, Jingyi Qiu, Xiayu Zhu, Rui Wen, Hao Zhang, Xiaohui Rong, Yong-Sheng Hu, Gaoping Cao&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: eScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:38:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667141725000631</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Chemical Reactivity Mapping: Exploring Chemical Reaction based on Digitalization of Small Molecules through Mayr’s Parameter</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1r6gz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>A new strategy for exploring novel reactions, utilizing Mayr’s reactivity parameters, is developed. We create a highly accurate prediction model of reactivity parameters using machine learning. Validating the reactivity scales in the reactions of isoquinoline and predicting the reactivity in commercially available chemicals lead to a new approach for exploring chemical reactions. Incorporating Mayr's reactivity parameters in both chemical reactivity mapping and chemical reaction space contributes to expedite the exploitation of reactions in small molecule syntheses.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-1r6gz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Guiding Ligand Selection in Copper-Catalyzed Cross Couplings via Principal Component Analysis</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-rqcts?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Copper-catalyzed Ullmann-type couplings are a promising alternative to Pd-catalyzed C-O and C-N bond formations. Recent discoveries of numerous second-generation ligands for Cu-mediated Ullmann-type cross-coupling reactions have broadened the scope to include less reactive aryl halides and nucleophiles and have also enabled lower copper and ligand loadings in these processes. However, in contrast to Pd chemistry, in-silico workflows for guiding systematic ligand selection from early-stage screening through optimization remain significantly less developed for Cu-catalyzed C-O and C-N bond coupling reactions. This report describes the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for streamlining ligand selection in Cu-catalyzed Ullmann-type coupling reactions. It provides a “map” of more than 80 ligands used in Ullmann couplings and is designed to reveal reactivity trends and highlight areas of high and low yields, thereby facilitating prioritization of high-value experiments in both medicinal and process chemistry settings. Validation for C-N and C-O couplings is provided using literature datasets, along with the development and application of a PCA-guided screening set for Ullmann couplings.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a fundamental problem in materials science. We present CrystalFormer-CSP, an efficient framework that unifies data-driven heuristic and physics-driven optimization approaches to predict stable crystal structures for given chemical compositions. The approach combines pretrained generative models for space-group-informed structure generation and a universal machine learning force field for energy minimization. Reinforcement fine-tuning can be employed to further boost the accuracy of the framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrystalFormer-CSP on benchmark problems and showcase its usage via web interface and language model integration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18251v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin Reorientation Driven Renormalization of Spin-Phonon Coupling in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18544</link><description>arXiv:2512.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tackling dataset curation challenges towards reliable machine learning: a case study on thermoelectric materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18653</link><description>arXiv:2512.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) driven discovery of novel and efficient thermoelectric (TE) materials warrants experimental TE datasets of high volume, diversity, and quality. While the largest publicly available dataset, Starrydata2, has a high data volume, it contains inaccurate data due to the inherent limitations of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted data curation, ambiguous nomenclature and complex formulas of materials in the literature. Another unaddressed issue is the inclusion of multi-source experimental data, with high standard deviations and without synthesis information. Using half-Heusler (hH) materials as an example, this work is aimed at first highlighting these errors and inconsistencies which cannot be filtered with conventional dataset curation workflows. We then propose a statistical round-robin error-based data filtering method to address these issues, a method that can be applied to filter any other material property. Lastly, a hybrid dataset creation workflow, involving data from Starrydata2 and manual extraction, is proposed and the resulting dataset is analyzed and compared against Starrydata2.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18653v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Topological surface phonons modulate thermal transport in semiconductor thin films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18757</link><description>arXiv:2512.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While phonon topology in crystalline solids has been extensively studied, its influence on thermal transport-especially in nanostructures-remains elusive. Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18757v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link><description>arXiv:2512.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19449v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Long-range electrostatics for machine learning interatomic potentials is easier than we thought</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18029</link><description>arXiv:2512.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of long-range electrostatics is a key limitation of modern machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), hindering reliable applications to interfaces, charge-transfer reactions, polar and ionic materials, and biomolecules. In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18029v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microstructure-based Variational Neural Networks for Robust Uncertainty Quantification in Materials Digital Twins</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18104</link><description>arXiv:2512.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aleatoric uncertainties - irremovable variability in microstructure morphology, constituent behavior, and processing conditions - pose a major challenge to developing uncertainty-robust digital twins. We introduce the Variational Deep Material Network (VDMN), a physics-informed surrogate model that enables efficient and probabilistic forward and inverse predictions of material behavior. The VDMN captures microstructure-induced variability by embedding variational distributions within its hierarchical, mechanistic architecture. Using an analytic propagation scheme based on Taylor-series expansion and automatic differentiation, the VDMN efficiently propagates uncertainty through the network during training and prediction. We demonstrate its capabilities in two digital-twin-driven applications: (1) as an uncertainty-aware materials digital twin, it predicts and experimentally validates the nonlinear mechanical variability in additively manufactured polymer composites; and (2) as an inverse calibration engine, it disentangles and quantitatively identifies overlapping sources of uncertainty in constituent properties. Together, these results establish the VDMN as a foundation for uncertainty-robust materials digital twins.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18104v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lattice-Renormalized Tunneling Models for Superconducting Qubit Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18156</link><description>arXiv:2512.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice-renormalized formalism for configurational tunneling two-level systems (TLS) that overcomes limitations of minimum-energy-path and light-particle models. Derived from the nuclear Hamiltonian, our formulation introduces composite phonon coordinates to capture lattice distortions between degenerate potential wells. This approach resolves deficiencies in prior models and enables accurate computation of tunnel splittings and excitation spectra for hydrogen-based TLS in bcc Nb. Our results bound experimental tunnel splittings and reveal strong anharmonic couplings between tunneling atoms and lattice phonons, establishing a direct link between TLS dynamics and phonon-mediated strain interactions. The formalism further generalizes to multi-level systems (MLS), providing insight into defect-induced decoherence in superconducting qubits and guiding strategies for materials design to suppress TLS-related loss.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Agentic Framework for Autonomous Materials Computation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19458</link><description>arXiv:2512.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating scientific discovery, yet their static knowledge and hallucination issues hinder autonomous research applications. Recent advances integrate LLMs into agentic frameworks, enabling retrieval, reasoning, and tool use for complex scientific workflows. Here, we present a domain-specialized agent designed for reliable automation of first-principles materials computations. By embedding domain expertise, the agent ensures physically coherent multi-step workflows and consistently selects convergent, well-posed parameters, thereby enabling reliable end-to-end computational execution. A new benchmark of diverse computational tasks demonstrates that our system significantly outperforms standalone LLMs in both accuracy and robustness. This work establishes a verifiable foundation for autonomous computational experimentation and represents a key step toward fully automated scientific discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19458v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Understanding the Lithium Ion Transport in Concentrated Block-Copolymer Electrolytes on a Microscopic Level</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11673</link><description>arXiv:2010.11673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block-copolymer electrolytes with lamellar microstructure show promising results regarding the ion transport in experiments. Motivated by these observations we study block-copolymers consisting of a polystyrene (PS) block and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block which were assembled in a lamellar structure. The lamella was doped with various amounts of lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) until very high loadings with ratios of EO monomers to cations up to 1:1 were reached. We present insights into the structure and ion transport from extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. For high salt concentrations most cations are not coordinated by PEO but rather by TFSI and THF. More specifically, LiTFSI partially separates from the PEO domain and forms a network-like structure in the middle of the lamella. This central salt-rich layer plays a decisive role to enable remarkably good cationic mobilities as well as high transport numbers in agreement with the experimental results.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2010.11673v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of multiple flat bands and van Hove singularities in the distorted kagome metal NdTi3Bi4</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11488</link><description>arXiv:2311.11488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials have attracted enormous research interest recently owing to their diverse topological phases and manifestation of electronic correlation. Here, we present the electronic structure of a distorted ferromagnetic kagome metal, NdTi3Bi4, exhibiting a transition temperature of 9 K. Our investigation employs a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover the presence of two flat bands which are found to originate from the kagome structure formed by Ti atoms with major contribution from Ti dxy and Ti dx2-y2 orbitals. We also observed multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) in its electronic structure, with one VHS lying near the Fermi level. The ARPES data reveals the existence of Dirac cone at the K point, a finding which is corroborated by our DFT calculations. These findings present detailed electronic structure capable of hosting correlation-driven phenomenon in this novel ferromagnetic kagome metal.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2311.11488v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep Variational Free Energy Calculation of Hydrogen Hugoniot</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18540</link><description>arXiv:2507.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model for the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow model for the unitary backflow transformation of electron coordinates in Hartree-Fock states. By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen for the temperature range where electrons occupy excited states. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. Our results bridge the gap between the results obtained by path-integral Monte Carlo calculations at high temperature and ground-state electronic methods at low temperature, thus providing a valuable benchmark for hydrogen in the warm dense matter region.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18540v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05114</link><description>arXiv:2509.05114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the {\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena, including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns. Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes localization in topological flat-band systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.05114v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Deep learning directed synthesis of fluid ferroelectric materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16671</link><description>arXiv:2512.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid ferroelectrics, a recently discovered class of liquid crystals that exhibit switchable, long-range polar order, offer opportunities in ultrafast electro-optic technologies, responsive soft matter, and next-generation energy materials. Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research. These results demonstrate a practical, closed-loop approach to discovering synthesizable fluid ferroelectrics, marking a step toward autonomous design of functional soft materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16671v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anti-Correlated Noise in Epoch-Based Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implications for Weight Variances in Flat Directions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05300</link><description>arXiv:2306.05300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization due to its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities. However, the gradient noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the common practice of epoch-based training where data is sampled without replacement. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise during epoch-based training under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, revealing that SGD noise is inherently anti-correlated over time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on the variance of weight fluctuations. We find that for directions with curvature of the loss greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the conventional predictions of isotropic weight variance under stationarity, based on uncorrelated and curvature-proportional noise, are recovered. Anti-correlations have negligible effect here. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, leading to a considerable decrease in loss fluctuations compared to the constant weight variance assumption. Furthermore, we present a numerical experiment where training with these anti-correlations enhances test performance, suggesting that the inherent noise structure induced by epoch-based training may play a role in finding flatter minima that generalize better.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2306.05300v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unified Micromechanics Theory of Composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14529</link><description>arXiv:2503.14529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14529v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Separating water content from network dynamics in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17362</link><description>arXiv:2504.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing forces, deformations and generally speaking the mechanical properties of cells is the hallmark of mechanobiology. In the last two decades many techniques have been developed to this end that are largely based on deforming the cells and measuring the reaction force. In cells, an alternative approach has been implemented mid 2010's, based on Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) that produces a spectrum that can be interpreted as the response of the sample to an infinitesimal uniaxial compression at picosecond timescales. In all of these measurements, the response of the cell is quantified with a colloquial "stiffness" that encompasses both the contribution of load-bearing structures and volume changes, much to confusion. To clarify the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that BLS shift alone is mostly sensitive to water content while the additional analysis of the linewidth allows identifying the contribution of the biopolymer-based network dynamics in living cells.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.17362v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] BOOM: Benchmarking Out-Of-distribution Molecular Property Predictions of Machine Learning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01912</link><description>arXiv:2505.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven molecular discovery leverages artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and generative modeling to filter and design novel molecules. Discovering novel molecules requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, but ML models struggle to generalize OOD. Currently, no systematic benchmarks exist for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present $\mathbf{BOOM}$, $\mathbf{b}$enchmarks for $\mathbf{o}$ut-$\mathbf{o}$f-distribution $\mathbf{m}$olecular property predictions: a chemically-informed benchmark for OOD performance on common molecular property prediction tasks. We evaluate over 150 model-task combinations to benchmark deep learning models on OOD performance. Overall, we find that no existing model achieves strong generalization across all tasks: even the top-performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x higher than in-distribution. Current chemical foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation, while models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. We perform extensive ablation experiments, highlighting how data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation impact OOD performance. Developing models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach to improve correctness in LLMs, however, in many scientific problems, the objective is not necessarily to produce the correct answer, but instead to produce a diverse array of candidates which satisfy a set of constraints. We study this challenge in the context of materials generation. To this end, we introduce PLaID++, an LLM post-trained for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We find that performance hinges on our crystallographic representation and reward formulation. First, we introduce a compact, symmetry-informed Wyckoff text representation which improves computational efficiency and encourages generalization from physical priors. Second, we demonstrate that temperature scaling acts as an entropy regularizer which counteracts mode collapse and encourages exploration. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.07150v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonreciprocal yet Symmetric Multi-Species Active Matter: Emergence of Chirality and Species Separation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18749</link><description>arXiv:2512.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal active matter systems typically feature an asymmetric role among interacting agents, such as a pursuer-evader relationship. We propose a multi-species nonreciprocal active matter model that is invariant under permutations of the particle species. The nonreciprocal, yet symmetric, interactions emerge from a constant phase shift in the velocity alignment interactions, rather than from an asymmetric coupling matrix. This system possessing permutation symmetry displays rich collective behaviors, including a species-mixed chiral phase with quasi-long-range polar order and a species separation phase characterized by vortex cells. The system also displays a coexistence phase of the chiral and the species separation phases, in which intriguing dynamic patterns emerge. These rich collective behaviors are a consequence of the interplay between nonreciprocity and permutation symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18749v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhanced sinterability and in vitro bioactivity of diopside through fluoride doping</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19014</link><description>arXiv:2512.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19014v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bridging the divide: Economic exchange and segregation in dual-income cities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18680</link><description>arXiv:2512.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segregation is a growing concern around the world. One of its main manifestations is the creation of ghettos, whose inhabitants have difficult access to well-paid jobs, which are often located far from their homes. In order to study this phenomenon, we propose an extension of Schelling's model of segregation to take into account the existence of economic exchanges. To approximate a geographical model of the city, we consider a small-world network with a defined real estate market. The evolution of the system has also been studied, finding that economic exchanges follow exponential laws and relocations are approximated by power laws. In addition to this, we consider the existence of delays in the actions of the agents, which mainly affect the happiness of those with fewer economic resources. Besides, the size of the economic exchange plays a crucial role in overall segregation. Despite its simplicity, we find that our model reproduces real-world situations such as the separation between favoured and handicapped economic areas, the importance of economic contacts between them to improve the distribution of wealth, and the existence of efficient and cheap transport to break the poverty cycles typical of disadvantaged zones.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.18680v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Information Supercurrents in Chiral Active Matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link><description>arXiv:2512.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative (phase rigidity) information supercurrents, analogous to a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically and empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and superconductivity.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16884v2</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Materials] In situ polymerization for high performance solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01035-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Materials, Published online: 23 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01035-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s43246-025-01035-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries promise high energy density, long-term performance, and enhanced safety, but face challenges with interfacial issues due to poor solid–solid contact.

This perspective argues that time-dependent structural change is a crucial, but often overlooked, mechanistic feature as many reactions simply do not follow a single, equilibrated minimum-energy path. We highlight examples where traditional transition state theory fails, typically cases involving short-lived interme-diates, non-equilibrium solvation, momentum-controlled selectivity, post-transition state bifurcations, and “hidden” dy-namic intermediates and show how molecular dynamics can reveal the actual sequence of structural change which gov-erns a reaction outcome. We also discuss emerging machine learning-based molecular dynamics which have found appli-cations in photochemistry and solvent modelling. While molecular dynamics will not replace methods based on transi-tion state theory, it offers organic chemists a time-resolved view of molecular structure which can be crucial to under-standing a given reaction. However, a central barrier for organic chemists is to understand when and why to apply an ad-vanced computational technique such as molecular dynamics simulations. In this perspective, we aim to introduce the methodology in sufficient detail to enable organic chemists to make this assessment and gain an appreciation for the im-portance of time in reaction mechanisms.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fclzt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Characterisation and immobilisation study of the Haloperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis: application to phenol derivatives</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jcmpt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>In the past decades, usage of enzymes to catalyse halogenation reactions has emerged as a greener approach compared to usual ones using toxic reagents and yielding to a bad atom economy. Vanadium dependent haloperoxidases (VDHals) are the most commonly used enzymes for such transformations in organic chemistry due to their robustness. Among them, haloperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) is the most cited in the literature but only barely characterized aside from its substrate spectrum and kinetic parameters. In the present study, we evaluated the melting temperature, thermostability, thermoactivity and solvent stability of CiVCPO in order to have a better overview of its potential in organic synthesis. We have also performed the first immobilisation study of this enzyme on 3 types of supports: 3 EziG™ glass beads coated with different polymers, 5 Relizyme™ polymethacrylate beads with different functional groups, the commercial Amberlite IRA900 and Dowex 50WX8, and 3 metal-organic frameworks from the UiO-66(Zr) family. As a result, we could retain 50% of total immobilized activity on 2 Relizyme supports (ethylamine (EA403) &amp; iminodiacetic (IDA403), with 55% activity kept over 5 recycling steps. The unconventional UiO-66(Zr) family also proved to be an interesting material for this enzyme. Finally, we show that free enzyme and supported enzyme are suitable for bromination and chlorination of a range of phenolic compounds with excellent yields with up to 65% conversion in 24 h in the tested conditions.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-jcmpt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Nanotechnology] Nanostructured niobium-doped nickel-rich multiphase positive electrode active material for high-power lithium-based batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Nanotechnology, Published online: 23 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41565-025-02092-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A two-step doping strategy for preparing Nb-doped Ni-rich positive electrode active materials forms nanosized grains and enables reversible multiphase transitions, improving lithium-ion transport and high-power performance of Li-based batteries.</description><author>Nature Nanotechnology</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02092-y</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Study of anion transport by amide-based macrocycles of different sizes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g4gds?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Synthetic anion receptors can transport anions across lipid bilayer membranes. Many anion transporters have been reported, including macrocyclic compounds. However, there are no systematic studies on how the size of macrocycles impacts their anion transport activity and selectivity. Therefore, we prepared eight amide-based macrocyclic compounds with ring sizes ranging from 18 to 26 atoms, as well as four bis-amides. We studied these compounds as anion receptors using chloride titrations and molecular modelling, and as anion transporters using liposomes with various fluorescent probes. Neither the size of the macrocycles nor the affinity for chloride were found to be determining factors for chloride transport activity; preorganisation appears to play a more important role. Fluorination was found to have a clear positive effect on anion transport rates, with the bis-amides performing surprisingly well compared to the macrocycles. The smallest non-fluorinated macrocycle exhibited selectivity for chloride over hydroxide and nitrate, whereas the pentafluorophenyl bis-amide demonstrated effective transport of bicarbonate and nitrate, likely due to anion-pi interactions in addition to hydrogen bonding. The insights from this study will shape the design of future anionophores.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g4gds?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ion-Conductive Vitrimers Based on Backbone-Type Triazolium Poly(ionic liquid)s: Counterion-Dependent Dynamics and Backbone Flexibility</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2mmg1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>To simultaneously achieve high ionic conductivity and recyclability, vitrimers were prepared using backbone-type triazolium poly(ionic liquid)s (TPILs) that integrate ionic transport with dynamic network rearrangement via trans-N-alkylation. TPIL elastomers bearing I⁻, BF₄⁻, PF₆⁻, and TFSI⁻ counteranions were synthesized from “clickable” ionic liquid monomers, and their glass transition temperature (Tg), ionic conductivity, and vitrimeric dynamics were compared. Only the I⁻-based network exhibited stress relaxation at 170 °C, indicating that nucleophilic anions are important for bond exchange. However, a trade-off was observed between ionic transport and dynamic network rearrangement. Furthermore, mixed-anion TPIL elastomers using I⁻+TFSI⁻ exhibited lower Tg and higher ionic conductivity than I⁻-based elastomer, while still maintaining vitrimer-like relaxation. The segmental relaxation was decoupled from Arrhenius-type bond-exchange dynamics. Ionic conduction was dominated by segmental motion, with minimal contribution from cross-link exchange. This design combining flexible polymer backbones and cooperative anion engineering can create recyclable, highly conductive polymer electrolytes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2mmg1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Advances in Calcium Isotope Purification and Analysis Using Cutting-Edge Signal Amplifiers for Matrix-Diverse Reference Materials</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ddk2z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Stable calcium (Ca) isotopes are increasingly applied across geosciences, medical sciences, ecology, paleontology, and archaeology. However, the deployment speed of Ca isotope applications worldwide is hampered by three major challenges: 1) the necessity for complex Ca purification procedures prior to analysis; 2) expensive instrumentation (typically TIMS or ICP-MS) requiring specific configurations and fine-tuning to generate reliable data; and 3) the exhaustion of some of the most widely used reference materials for cross-laboratory comparisons. In this study we present methodological advances aimed at lifting some of these barriers. First, we refined existing chromatography methods for purifying Ca by developing a branching procedure based on commercially available labware to allow faster method transfer and to minimize resin and reagent consumption for a variety of sample matrices. Our adjustments drastically improved strontium (Sr) separation from Ca, including for Sr-rich samples such as seawater. Second, we explored the potential of 10¹³Ω Faraday cup amplifiers for improving Ca isotope measurements. Our results show improved precision in 43Ca measurements under low ionic transmission configurations with δ43/42Ca standard deviation value reduced by half. This expands the list of ICP-MS configurations capable of producing reliable Ca isotope measurements and delineates a path for less sample-destructive methods (i.e., lower Ca analytical requirements). These amplifiers also markedly enhanced the correction of Sr²⁺ interferences typically affecting Ca ion beams. In this configuration, accurate and precise Ca isotopic measurements were obtained without prior Sr removal for Sr/Ca concentration ratios up to 10⁻². Lastly, using these technical advancements we analyzed existing and new international certified reference materials (SRM1486, SRM1400, IAPSO, CACB-1, DOLT-5, DORM-5, TORT-3), complementing existing and out-of-stock standards of the Ca isotope toolbox, notably for Ca carbonate and marine soft tissues. Together, these advances open the door of Ca isotope research to more laboratories and pave the way for future developments and applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-ddk2z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Predicting Sequence Dependent Fluorescence with Classic Machine Learning Models</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs62c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Terminally labeled DNA oligonucleotides have wide applications in modern biology and biotechnological applications. It has been observed that the fluorescent intensity of light released from these fluorescent labels is heavily influenced by the terminal sequence of nucleotides. Recent studies have assayed and published the raw fluorescent values of  Cy3 and Cy5 as a function of the most adjacent 5 nucleotides resulting in 1024 data points. While experimentally tractable, an increase in the sequence space will vastly increase the experimental and time cost. Machine Learning is well suited to addressing the issue of experimental tractability however there is a wide design space in the choice of algorithms. In this work we use classic machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptrons and Random Forests to both predict the raw intensity value and classify the intensity magnitude of the fluorophore using the sequence as input. We demonstrate that the performance of these models is heavily dependent on the numerical transformation of the sequence and that Random Forest consistently outperforms all other models in both regression and classification tasks irrespective of the sequence transformation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hs62c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine learning driven advances in molecular dynamics of bulk and interfacial aqueous systems</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6vdl2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been widely applied to investigate various physical and chemical processes in aqueous and interfacial environments, which are crucial for the design of energy materials and for understanding several chemical processes at the heart of life itself. However, the applicability of MD simulations has been constrained by several inherent challenges, including the accuracy of force fields, limitations in simulation size and timescales. One promising solution to these challenges is the integration of machine learning (ML) methods, both for improved description of the nature of interactions in aqueous systems as well as for enhanced sampling. In this review, we discuss the principles, implementation, and applications of ML force fields (MLFFs) and ML enhanced sampling methods to the study of aqueous, interfacial systems. We discuss five key categories of applications that use MLFFs, ML-enhanced sampling, and ML-driven data analytics. We first discuss how MLFFs are enabling quantum level accuracy at classical level cost for large scale simulations of complex aqueous and interfacial systems, and then highlight how coupling them with enhanced sampling and advanced data analytics, especially graph based approaches for featurizing such systems, can be used both for enhancing simulations and for understanding them by yielding reliable low dimensional reaction coordinates that improve the interpretation of high dimensional MD data. The discussed applications include investigations into the structure and dynamics of bulk water and aqueous interfaces, proton transfer, catalysis, phase transitions, and the prediction of vibrational spectra. In each case, we highlight how ML-based methods enable simulations that were previously computationally prohibitive and provide new physical insights into aqueous solutions and interfaces. For instance, MLFFs allow nanosecond-scale simulations with thousands of atoms while maintaining quantum chemistry accuracy. Additionally, ML-enhanced sampling facilitates the crossing of large reaction barriers and enables the exploration of extensive configuration spaces. Moreover, ML models trained on simulation data uncover previously overlooked factors, such as the role of solvent dynamics in phase transitions. The combination of MLFFs with enhanced sampling techniques makes the calculation of high-dimensional free energy surfaces feasible, significantly improving our understanding of chemical reactions. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in this field and outline potential future research directions to further advance the integration of ML in MD simulations.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6vdl2-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

We systematically investi- gate data selection strategies to optimize the Chebyshev Interaction Model for Efficient Simulation (ChIMES) po- tential for the Bi-Pt nanoclusters by comparing three innovative sampling methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)/k-means (structural diversity), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)/k-means (force-space di- versity), and hierarchical clustering. Quantitatively, the PCA/k-means strategy proved most effective for global ac- curacy, yielding the lowest force errors and achieving energy root mean square errors (RMSE) values competitive with DFT, demonstrating excellent accuracy (19.16 meV/atom). Structural validation on 34 unique DFT-optimized isomers further confirmed the potential’s high fidelity, with the best model PCA/k-means reproducing structures with an average root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.10 Å. However, the t-SNE methods, by maximizing diversity in the force space, demonstrated superior extrapolative power, leading to the more precise prediction of a novel stel- lated octadecagon Bi18Pt24 cage structure, demonstrating the potential for exploring previously unseen morphologies. Our results establish a clear methodology for strategic data sampling that successfully maximizes ML-IAP transfer- ability, providing an accurate and computationally efficient tool that accelerates the theoretical discovery of complex bimetallic architectures.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-g77x9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] High-Performance Semiempirical Excited-State Molecular Dynamics: A Step Toward Data-Driven Photodynamics</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6h565?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We introduce excited-state molecular dynamics (ESMD) in PYSEQM, a GPU-accelerated semiempirical quantum chemistry engine implemented in PyTorch. The new module enables Born-Oppenheimer (single-surface) dynamics using configuration-interaction singles and random phase approximation for excited-states, allowing long trajectories and large statistical ensembles to be simulated efficiently on a single GPU. We also implement an extended-Lagrangian ESMD (XL-ESMD) scheme that propagates auxiliary electronic variables, enabling relaxed ground and excited-state convergence thresholds without compromising energy conservation. The ESMD implementation scales smoothly from small chromophores to a nearly 900-atom dendrimer (taking 6.5 s per ESMD step). PYSEQM also supports batched execution, allowing many geometries or trajectories to be evaluated in a single GPU launch, substantially increasing throughput and making ensemble-based protocols routine. As a demonstration, we compute absorption, emission, and infrared spectra from trajectories propagated on the ground and first excited states, illustrating practical utility of PYSEQM. The XL-ESMD scheme yields identical spectra at significantly lower computational cost, establishing the role of extended Lagrangian based dynamics for efficient ESMD simulations. Beyond raw performance, PYSEQM’s Pytorch foundation provides  automatic differentiation for forces, efficient GPU batching, and seamless interfacing with machine learning models. These capabilities position PYSEQM as practical platform for machine learning-augmented excited-state dynamics and lay the foundation for future data-driven nonadiabatic ESMD modeling of ultrafast spectroscopic probes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6h565?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Mixed ionic–electronic conductor based on B 16  framework</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251904/3375535/Mixed-ionic-electronic-conductor-based-on-B16</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) are essential materials for next-generation energy storage and conversion systems. However, several limitations—including the scarcity of intrinsic MIEC materials, low ionic conductivity, and a narrow operational temperature range—restrict their practical use. Based on the experimentally synthesized MgB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal, this study designs a B&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; covalent framework with three-dimensionally connected channels by theoretically removing Mg atoms through computational methods. Using first-principles calculations and machine learning molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically explore its compounds' potential as intrinsic MIEC materials. The results indicate that the B&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; framework can stably host and transport Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with different valences. The formations of LiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BeB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and AlB&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; enter superionic states at 1200, 1700, and 1400 K, respectively, with ionic conductivities reaching 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm, and the optimal electronic conductivities approaching 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm. The framework shows good structural stability: the volume change after ion insertion is less than 12.4%, and its mechanical properties (for example, a shear modulus of 47.8 GPa) are comparable to those of traditional electrode materials like LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NCM. Through defect engineering, LiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with 12.5% crystal defects can lower the superionic transition temperature to 400 K while maintaining a high ionic conductivity of 1.65 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm.

However, most techniques measure quantities dependent on multiple biophysical properties rather than individual ones, limiting their biological/clinical relevance. Here, we present a single-cell biophysical phenotyping technique that quantifies size (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dc&lt;/span&gt;) and elastic modulus (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;) of cells deforming at different levels along constriction microchannels. A physical model is developed to resolve features of multiple deformation stages into &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dc&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;. Parallel-channel device design achieves a reasonably high throughput of ∼10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells/min. The measurement employs lock-in amplification-assisted electrokinetic sensing via embedded electrodes across three channel sections with varying constriction widths, inducing distinct cell deformations. We demonstrate the technique by profiling normal and cancerous breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231), as well as drug-treated cancer cells (cytochalasin D, cetuximab, and lysophosphatidic acid). The biophysical phenotyping enables cell classification with high accuracy (&amp;gt;95.45% via principal component analysis; &amp;gt;97.32% via machine learning). This approach offers robust and high-throughput cell classification, with potential applications in basic research and clinical diagnostics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Open Issues</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/253702/3375461/High-throughput-sensing-of-single-cell-properties</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Open Issues] Coherent phonon tunneling-driven ultralow and non-monotonic thermal conductivity in quasi-0D Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/252201/3375357/Coherent-phonon-tunneling-driven-ultralow-and-non</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Low-dimensional copper halides have emerged as promising thermoelectric materials due to their phonon-glass electron-crystal behavior, yet their thermal transport mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Using &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ab initio&lt;/span&gt; calculations and a unified thermal transport theory, we identify that Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; possesses an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;κ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.126 W/(m K) at room temperature (RT)—one of the lowest among metal halides. Above RT, coherent phonon tunneling dominates over particle-like propagation, resulting in glass-like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;κ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; in all directions. Intriguingly, the competing contributions of coherent and incoherent terms induce an anomalous non-monotonic temperature dependence of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;κ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; along the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; axis, with an initial decrease followed by an unexpected rise.

However, a significant barrier to their development is the lack of a comprehensive materials database, which hinders systematic studies and the discovery of emergent AOS materials. This study addresses this gap by constructing a dedicated database of zinc-tin-based doped oxide semiconductors (Zn–M–Sn–O) and their thin-film transistor (TFT) performance parameters, compiled from an extensive review of existing literature. Our research aims to perform a systematic analysis of the correlations between key material properties and device performance. We summarize and analyze existing Zn–M–Sn–O based optoelectronic devices, extracting key features such as material compositions, processing parameters, and performance metrics. These features are then used to construct feature vectors. By applying a machine learning algorithm to this dataset, we establish a performance prediction model for Zn–M–Sn–O TFTs. This machine learning-assisted approach allows us to efficiently screen materials and predict the optimal M element for high-performance devices. This methodology significantly accelerates the discovery and development of advanced AOS materials, paving the way for next-generation optoelectronic technologies.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Open Issues</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/25/251903/3375349/Machine-learning-assisted-performance-prediction</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Thermal conductivity limits of MoS 2  and MoSe 2 : Revisiting high-order anharmonic lattice dynamics with machine learning potentials</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ( κ) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs), including recently developed foundation models. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and HIPHIVE against density functional theory and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on  κ. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Missense mutations in cancer: in silico predictions, developing treatments, and overcoming cell resistance.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6928d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Targeted therapies built around specific genetic driver mutations have become a cornerstone of precision oncology. These mutations, often found in oncogenes such as KRAS or tumor suppressors such as TP53, contribute to tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. Recent successes with KRAS inhibitors targeting G12C and G12D mutations highlight the clinical potential of mutation-specific drug design. Concurrently, advances in machine learning have enhanced the prediction of missense variant effects by integrating amino acid dynamics, structural perturbations, and pathogenicity scoring. This review synthesizes current computational tools and emerging therapeutic strategies, including small-molecule inhibitors, protein degraders, proximity-based therapeutics, and gene or cellular therapies, to provide a comprehensive framework linking structure–function relationships to the rational design of next-generation cancer treatments.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-6928d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Domain Oriented Universal Machine Learning Potential Enables Fast Exploration of Chemical Space of Battery Electrolytes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fnw1w-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Li-ion batteries, widely used in electronic devices, electric vehicles, and aviation, demand high energy density, fast charging capabilities, and broad operating temperature ranges. Computations combined with experiments have gained increasing attention for electrolyte development. However, the inherent complexity of electrolytes poses a significant challenge. Classical molecular dynamics often fails due to inaccuracies in force field parameters, while ab initio calculationsarelimitedbyhighcomputationalcosts. Recently, machinelearning molecular dynamics has emerged as an efficient and accurate alternative. However, its application is hindered by limited transferability of machine learning potentials. In this work, we developed a universal machine learning potential for electrolytes using an iterative training approach on randomly composed datasets, enabling the accurate computation of key properties for a broad range of electrolytes via molecular dynamics. Furthermore, coordination dynamics analysis of Li ion, by quantifying the coordination lifetime, provides a direct, quantitative measure of solvation strength. The universal machine learning potential for electrolytes facilitates the prediction and optimization of electrolyte properties, offering a powerful tool for electrolyte design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fnw1w-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Large-scale structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis enables functional annotation of animal venom peptides</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gd3c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Animal venoms constitute one of the most chemically diverse and pharmacologically rich peptide repertoires in nature, yet the vast majority of venom peptides remain structurally and functionally unannotated due to limited material availability and a paucity of experimentally solved structures. This knowledge gap has significantly constrained both mechanistic understanding and translational applications of venom-derived molecules. Here we conduct a comprehensive structure- and sequence-based comparative analysis of close to 4,000 venom peptides (i.e. teretoxins and conotoxins) from marine snails using AlphaFold2. While conotoxins have been studied for over six decades, teretoxins remain largely unexplored. Our study provides the first comprehensive structural classification and functional annotation of the entire known teretoxin repertoire, substantially expanding the venom peptide landscape. Structural clustering analysis revealed that both teretoxins and conotoxins form a large number of structural clusters (225 and 307 clusters, respectively), with each cluster characterized by conserved cysteine frameworks and disulfide connectivity. Importantly, combining structural clusters with phylogenetic analysis revealed that structure prediction together with cysteine frameworks offer an improved strategy for venom peptide classification. We used predicted disulfide connectivity from derived from AlphaFold2 models to annotate the majority of uncharacterized conotoxins on ConoServer database, addressing a long-standing classification bottleneck in venom peptide classification efforts. As a concrete demonstration of functional prediction, co-clustering of predicted teretoxin and conotoxin structures led to the identification of teretoxins structurally homologous to conotoxins with described activities, suggesting shared functional activities such as Kunitz-type peptide activity, neurotoxicity, and ion channel inhibition. Using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on our Kunitz-type peptide co-cluster, we observed that conotoxin P07849 and teretoxin Tar2.9 engage trypsin in a manner similar to the Kunitz Domain 1 (KD1) of the Alzheimer’s amyloid beta-protein precursor (APPI), a previously unappreciated protease inhibitory role for this venom peptide family. Overall, this work establishes a scalable, structure-centric framework that combines structure prediction, structural clustering, co-clustering, and phylogenetics for deorphanizing venom peptides, enabling predicted annotation and functional inference for future experimental, pharmacological, and therapeutic exploration.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-9gd3c?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Performance of dispersion models in predicting ambient hydrocarbon concentrations at a regional air quality monitor in an oil and gas producing region</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xkhh9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The performance of four widely used dispersion models (AERMOD, a single equation Gaussian formulation, and two versions of CALPUFF) for predicting ambient hydrocarbon concentrations at a regional air quality monitor in the Eagle Ford Shale oil and gas production region was assessed. Model performance is found to vary considerably based on the performance objective, meteorological conditions, and temporal resolution. Among the models evaluated in this work, the methods used to estimate the dispersion coefficients and whether the model was plume- or puff-based strongly influenced model performance. Uncertainties in meteorological and emissions inputs also played an important role in model performance, but the significance of their impact varied depending on the performance objective. Techniques to identify and address model uncertainties and for selecting the best performing model for a given application are suggested.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xkhh9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine Learning-Guided Scope Selection to Balance Performance and Substrate Similarity</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r0sst?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The determination of a reaction substrate scope enables downstream users to decide whether the reaction in question is suitable for their envisioned application. The information content of the scope, as demonstrated by its performance and diversity, is crucial to inform the quality of this decision. Herein, we report a broadly applicable and easy to use machine learning algorithm, ScopeBO, for the selection of scopes that balance these two aspects. We use the Vendi score as a metric for scope diversity and establish a scope score that quantifies scope performance within the context of a specific chemical search space. The hyperparameters of ScopeBO are optimized using these metrics, and its performance is validated with several reaction datasets, demonstrating favorable performance against that of alternative selection methods. Through this quantitative optimization, ScopeBO provides an approach towards objective and standardized scope selection that maximizes the information content of the evaluated substrates.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-r0sst?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Relationship Between Local Disorder and Atomic Motion in an Antiperovskite Solid Electrolyte</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dxdtz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Solid-state electrolytes are an alternative to conventional liquid systems for safer and more efficient batteries, whereas a shift from Li to Na would unlock systems with increased resource availability and simplified supply chains. Antiperovskite Na2[NH2][BH4] recently emerged as a candidate that showcases that internal polyanion dynamics can facilitate Na transport. However, experimental validation of the predicted mechanisms of atomic motion remains scarce. To this end, we investigate the intricate relationship between local atomic disorder and dynamic motion. Maps of atomic disorder from total scattering data reproduce the predictions of polyanion rotation and Na translation by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The comparison also reveals the concurrence of BD4- translations, which were overlooked in previous analyses, and the existence of static disorder due to the different degrees of freedom of each anion, even while maintaining their ideal shape. This complex interplay refines mechanisms governing ion dynamics that determine solid-state electrolyte functionality. Realistic design strategies for rotor-based electrolytes must explicitly account for polyanion translation and static disorder, rather than optimizing rotational freedom in isolation. The combination of total scattering experiments with AIMD provides a route to screen potential polyanion-based candidates for favorable multi-modal disorder, thus steering the discovery of new phases with transformational ionic conductivity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-dxdtz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Multi-Objective Catalyst Discovery in High-Entropy Alloy Composition Space: The Role of Noble Metals on the Pareto Front for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cq92m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Discovering new materials for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions is a key step toward energy sustainability. However, for catalysts to be viable in practice, they must perform in multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. We demonstrate this challenge for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where activity, stability, and material cost must be balanced. Using the continuous composition space of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) together with our established models for activity and dissolution, we identify a Pareto-optimal set of ORR catalysts within the Ag–Au–Cu–Ir–Pd–Pt–Rh–Ru system via multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we introduce a fine-tuned machine learning model that predicts adsorption energies for alloys spanning 12 elements and 9 adsorbates.  Our results show that alloying expands the hypervolume spanned by the Pareto front, consisting of low- to medium-entropy alloys composed primarily of Ag, Au, Cu, Pd, and Pt. We further propose an approach for analyzing the Pareto front by quantifying the loss in hypervolume when critical elements (Au, Pd, and Pt) are removed, clarifying their relative contributions to optimal performance.  This work highlights the need to consider all relevant objectives in catalyst optimization and the advantage of HEAs as a powerful platform for multi-objective catalyst discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-cq92m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Agent-based framework for modeling hyperlocal urban air quality</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-v1lhr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Urban air quality exhibits significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity at hyperlocal scales, necessitating advanced modeling paradigms that can bridge the gap between computationally intensive physics-based models and empirically-driven statistical approaches. This paper introduces a novel agent-based modeling framework specifically designed for hyperlocal air quality assessment, capable of providing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. The proposed framework discretizes urban environments into interacting agents, with pollutant dynamics governed by a parameterized mass balance that preserves fundamental physics while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is demonstrated through a case study in Chennai, India, using mobile monitoring data across a 25 km route with 250 m spatial resolution. Geospatial features (traffic, land use, meteorology) are encoded as agent properties through physically interpretable parameters. This enables transparent attribution of pollution sources and transport pathways, thereby strengthening the framework’s descriptive capabilities. The approach successfully captures complex spatio-temporal pollution dynamics and describes pollution hotspots by attributing them to source and transport influences. Predictive capabilities are demonstrated through spatio-temporal interpolation and temporal forecasting. Spatio-temporal formulation of the framework enables it to outperform regular unidimensional methods. The discrete agent structure facilitates prescriptive applications, demonstrated here through identification of least-exposure routes between locations.

This approach identified 12 discriminatory metabolites, with succinate showing a stepwise increase from health to sepsis to SAE and associations with clinical severity scores.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02781-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Feature-Selective Preprocessing with Electrically Robust Boron Nitride-Based Dynamic Memristors for Reliable Lightweight Neural Networks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967/asset/images/medium/nn5c16967_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c16967&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:05:25 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c16967</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Interpreting X-ray Diffraction Patterns of Metal–Organic Frameworks via Generative Artificial Intelligence</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c16416/asset/images/medium/ja5c16416_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c16416&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:03:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Free-energy perturbation in the exchange-correlation space accelerated by machine learning: application to silica polymorphs</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01874-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 20 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01874-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-025-01874-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Free-energy perturbation in the exchange-correlation space accelerated by machine learning: application to silica polymorphs</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01874-1</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] A Transformative Molecular Muscle Solid Electrolyte</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18427</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18427/asset/images/medium/ja5c18427_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18427&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:12:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18427</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small Structures: Table of Contents] Li6−xFe1−xAlxCl8 Solid Electrolytes for Cost‐Effective All‐Solid‐State LiFePO4 Batteries</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sstr.202500728?af=R</link><description>Small Structures, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small Structures: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 18:40:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/sstr.202500728</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Unravelling Electronic Structure and Molecular Vibrations of Proteins in Virus Using Novel Correlated Plasmon‐Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy With Machine Learning</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202506967?af=R</link><description>Small, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:08:23 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202506967</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

The optimized Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4 achieves a Li+ conductivity of 1.16 × 10−5 S cm−1, two orders of magnitude higher than that of analogous Li2TiF6. Combining the inherent high-voltage stability of fluoride and the excellent ionic conductivity of Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4, this material enables superior 5 V-class all-solid-state battery performance. This work opens a new avenue for designing high-conductivity fluoride SSEs and advancing the performance of 5 V-class all-solid-state batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00414-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Adsorb-Agent: Autonomous Identification of Stable Adsorption Configurations via Large Language Model Agent</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00298B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00298B, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Janghoon Ock,  Radheesh Sharma Meda, Tirtha  Vinchurkar, Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani&lt;br /&gt;Adsorption energy is a key reactivity descriptor in catalysis.

Here, we investigate croconic acid, a hydrogen-bonded organic ferroelectric, using real-time time-dependent density functional theory to uncover the microscopic mechanisms of light-induced structural transitions and nonlinear optical responses. High-order harmonic generation in croconic acid is found to be highly sensitive to proton displacement within hydrogen bonds, with polarization switching reshaping internal electronic asymmetry and modulating intersite electron currents. Subangstrom-scale lattice distortions induce marked enhancements or suppressions in the harmonics, highlighting the extreme sensitivity of the nonlinear response to hydrogen-bond configuration. These results reveal a light-driven electron–proton–lattice interaction mechanism in organic ferroelectrics, providing a route toward tunable ultrafast photonic and optoelectronic devices based on molecular materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/241102/3374918/Ultrafast-laser-induced-anharmonic-lattice</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Spin-splitting-torque-driven field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in RuO 2 /synthetic antiferromagnet heterostructures for spintronic convolutional neural networks</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/242405/3374916/Spin-splitting-torque-driven-field-free</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;With the growing demand for low-power and high-speed spintronic devices, the development of advanced material systems with efficient spin control capabilities has emerged as a central focus in spintronics research.

This study investigates the factors that make some odors more evocative than others. We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes.

Predictive biomarkers of response could help guide treatment decisions, yet none have reached clinical practice. In this exploratory study, we integrated six publicly available transcriptomic datasets and applied machine learning to derive a 186-gene signature predictive of nCRT response. The signature showed good performance in cross-validation (AUC 0.80) and was associated with consensus molecular (CMS4) and immune (iCMS3) subtypes enriched in responders.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02716-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Combining DNA Methylation Features and Clinical Characteristics Predicts Ketamine Treatment Response for PTSD</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02706-3?rss=yes</link><description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits extensive clinical and biological variability, making treatment challenging.

Using first-principles calculations, we identify Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as stable MXenes. Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent performance with low voltages (0.07 V for F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and high specific capacities (394.8 mAh/g for F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). The storage mechanism involves covalent bonding between surface N and halide-ions, where adsorption strength is governed by the energy difference between occupied &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and unoccupied &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;π&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals and their electron overlap.

We propose a thermo-mechanical coupling framework for nanosecond laser ablation based on energy conservation, which is embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to enable simultaneous inversion of multiple mechanical properties. A thermo-mechanical coupling coefficient is defined to uniformly describe the dynamic allocation of input laser energy among thermal diffusion, mechanical work, and plasma shielding across different deformation stages under laser irradiation. Furthermore, hard-to-measure physical characteristics in the coupled equation are replaced with experimentally accessible features obtained through the simultaneous acquisition of spectroscopic, shockwave, and surface-wave signals. Using 210 experimental datasets, the framework simultaneously recovers Young's modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and micro-Vickers hardness with high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9927, 0.9912, 0.9916, and 0.9959, respectively), significantly outperforming the baseline method (ultrasonic velocity regression for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0012). Comparisons with linear normalization and unconstrained neural networks demonstrate that PINN achieves near-unity accuracy through the embedding of conservation-law constraints. Partial dependency analysis further uncovers the nonlinear coupling laws between input features and mechanical properties. The proposed paradigm, integrating conservation laws, measurable features, and physics-informed learning, offers a universal approach for non-contact, high-precision, and physically consistent multi-to-multi inversion of multiple material properties under nanosecond laser ablation conditions.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/24/244101/3374784/Measurement-of-multiple-mechanical-properties-from</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Deep learning based SEM image analysis for predicting ionic conductivity in LiZr2(PO4)3-based solid electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00232J" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00232J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kento Murakami, Yudai Yamaguchi, Yo Kato, Kazuki Ishikawa, Naoto Tanibata, Hayami Takeda, Masanobu Nakayama, Masayuki Karasuyama&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-ion-conductive oxide materials have attracted considerable attention as solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Hierarchical Attention Graph Learning with LLMs Enhancement for Molecular Solubility Prediction</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00407A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00407A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yangxin Fan, Yinghui  Wu, Roger French, Danny Perez, Michael Taylor, Ping Yang&lt;br /&gt;Solubility quantifies the concentration of a molecule that can dissolve in a given solvent.

While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn–Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06, and can be applied to study unseen adsorbate coverages. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Contextualized biomedical language processing enhances ICU survival prediction</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02703-8?rss=yes</link><description>Accurate prediction of intensive care unit (ICU) survival remains challenging due to heterogeneous clinical data.

Nonetheless, such topological devices remain elusive. In this study, we implemented the polar topological domain structures as neuromorphic computing elements, and present 12-state non-volatile ferroelectric topological nanodevices that demonstrate exceptional neuromorphic computing capabilities through the controlled formation and erasure of walls. These nanodevices exhibit near-linear long-term potentiation and long-term depression characteristics under repetitive voltage pulses, achieving a remarkable dynamic range. Simulations using a convolutional neural network model with these devices attain 95% recognition accuracy on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digits dataset within 100 epochs. These results expand the functional scope of polar topological electronic devices to future neuromorphic computing systems.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041420/3374577/Construction-of-polar-topological-nanodevices-for</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Optimizing Data Extraction from Materials Science Literature: A Study of Tools Using Large Language Models</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00482A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00482A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wenkai Ning, Jeffrey Robert Reimers, Musen Li, Rika Kobayashi&lt;br /&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for large-scale extraction and organization of unstructured data owing to their exceptional Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities.

MRPARCv2 introduces hierarchical discretization and cross-resolution feature communication to improve the accuracy and efficiency of flow simulations. We evaluate the model on a challenging 2D turbulent radiative layer dataset from The Well multi-physics benchmark repository and demonstrate significant improvements when compared to the single resolution baseline model, in both Variance Scaled Root Mean Squared Error and physics-driven metrics, including turbulent kinetic energy spectra and mass–temperature distributions. Despite having 30% fewer trainable parameters, MRPARCv2 outperforms its predecessor by up to 50% in roll-out prediction error and 86% in spectral error. A preliminary study on uncertainty quantification was performed, and we also analyzed the model’s performance under different levels of abstractions of the flow, specifically on sampling subsets of field variables. We find that the absence of physical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) in the network architecture leads to degraded accuracy. A variable substitution experiment confirms that this issue persists regardless of which physical quantity is predicted directly. Our findings highlight the advantages of multi-resolution inductive bias for capturing multi-scale flow dynamics and suggest the need for future PIML models to embed EOS knowledge to enhance physical fidelity.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046110/3374061/Multi-resolution-physics-aware-recurrent</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Understanding and mitigating distribution shifts for universal machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00260E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00260E" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00260E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S.

Yet the link between sensorimotor recalibration to new physical conditions and cognitive updating of internal models remains unclear. We addressed this using altered gravity as a model system. In a within-subject study, 25 adults completed a virtual-reality task requiring motor adjustment to non-terrestrial gravities and an online problem-solving task requiring physical reasoning under matched gravity manipulations.

Herein, we synthesized layered BiOI transparent single crystals through a tellurium-assisted chemical vapor transport strategy. Systematic investigation reveals that tellurium acts as a critical transport agent, directly modulating the crystallization dynamics and enabling the growth of high-quality 1-cm single crystals with precise size control. The layered BiOI crystals demonstrate excellent broadband (254–940 nm) photoresponse performance, achieving a remarkable responsivity of 123.7 A·W&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and specific detectivity of 7.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Notably, the implementation of gate voltage regulation allows dynamic control of carrier transport mechanisms, achieving efficient regulation of the photoresponse of the device. This unique gate-tunable characteristic enables dual-mode operation in image recognition systems, simultaneously supporting both high-sensitivity detection and programmable contrast enhancement. The combination of scalable crystal growth and multifunctional optoelectronic properties positions BiOI as a promising candidate for next-generation intelligent photodetection technologies.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041418/3374123/Gate-tunable-dual-mode-BiOI-photodetector-for</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Label‐Free Detection of Nuclear Envelope Nucleoporation using 2D Morphological Embeddings and Machine Learning</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202504402?af=R</link><description>Small, Volume 21, Issue 48, December 3, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:24:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202504402</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Reagentless Real‐Time ATP Monitoring with New DNA Aptamers</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202508898?af=R</link><description>Small, Volume 21, Issue 48, December 3, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:24:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202508898</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Machine Learning‐Enabled Polymer Discovery for Enhanced Pulmonary siRNA Delivery</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202502805?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 2, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202502805</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Enhanced Potassium Ion Diffusion and Interface Stability Enabled by Potassiophilic rGO/CNTs/NaF Micro‐Lattice Aerogel for High‐Performance Potassium Metal Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202508586?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 35, Issue 49, December 2, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202508586</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Reviews Physics] Predicting high-entropy alloy phases with machine learning</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-025-00903-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Reviews Physics, Published online: 03 December 2025;

By separating structure learning from data synthesis, genESOM enables dimensionality modulation and injection of engineered diagnostic features, i.e., permuted versions of real variables, as negative controls that track feature importance stability.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02582-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Advances in Thermal Modeling and Simulation of Lithium‐Ion Batteries with Machine Learning Approaches</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500147?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 22:39:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500147</guid></item><item><title>[APL Machine Learning Current Issue] RTNinja : A generalized machine learning framework for analyzing random telegraph noise signals in nanoelectronic devices</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046109/3373556/RTNinja-A-generalized-machine-learning-framework</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt;, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;LevelsExtractor&lt;/span&gt;, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;SourcesMapper&lt;/span&gt;, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046109/3373556/RTNinja-A-generalized-machine-learning-framework</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A pilot study: Incorporating Treponema pallidum antigens into machine learning models for accurate syphilis treatment outcome assessment</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</link><description>Health informatics; disease; artificial intelligence applications</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Bathymetry of the Philippine Sea with Convolution Neural Network from Multisource Marine Geodetic Data</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02546-5?rss=yes</link><description>This study developed a deep learning-based method for high resolution bathymetry prediction in the Philippine Sea, aiming to improve the accuracy of seafloor depth estimation using multi-source marine geodetic data.

We present the deterministic characterization with an integrated parallelizable hybrid resolver architecture, a hybrid machine learning framework designed for fast, accurate analysis of XFEL diagnostics using angular streaking-based sinogram images. This architecture integrates convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory models to denoise input, identify x-ray sub-spike features, and extract sub-spike relative delays with sub-30 attosecond temporal resolution. Deployed on low-latency hardware, it achieves over 10 kHz throughput with 168.3 &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;s inference latency, indicating scalability to 14 kHz with field-programmable gate array integration. By transforming regression tasks into classification problems and leveraging optimized error encoding, we achieve high precision with low-latency performance that is critical for real-time streaming event selection and experimental control feedback signals.

We create a database of all two-generated subgroups of the symmetric group on n-objects and conduct a classification of finite simple groups among them using shallow feed-forward neural networks. We show that this neural network classifier can decipher the property of simplicity with varying accuracies depending on the features. Our neural network model leads to a natural conjecture concerning the generators of a finite simple group. We subsequently prove this conjecture. This new toy theorem comments on the necessary properties of generators of finite simple groups. We show this explicitly for a class of sporadic groups for which the result holds. Our work further makes the case for a machine motivated study of algebraic structures in pure mathematics and highlights the possibility of generating new conjectures and theorems in mathematics with the aid of machine learning.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1d98</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

This review explores the synergistic integration of metasurfaces—engineered sub-wavelength planar structures—and quantum optics, which exploits quantum mechanical principles to manipulate light at the most granular level. We outline the design principles, fabrication processes, and computational challenges involved in creating quantum metasurfaces, discussing both forward and inverse design approaches. Advances in nanofabrication and intelligent optimization techniques, such as machine learning and topology optimization, have enabled the development of metasurfaces with unparalleled control over electromagnetic waves. We examine recent progress in using quantum metasurfaces for single-photon and multi-photon generation, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing, showcasing how these innovations achieve unprecedented precision and novel functionalities. Additionally, we highlight the integration of metasurfaces into quantum light manipulation, emphasizing their role in enhancing wavefront shaping and entanglement control. By providing a comprehensive survey of current advancements and future research directions, this review highlights the vast potential of metasurfaces and quantum optics at the crossroads, setting the stage for next-generation technological innovations that will define the forthcoming decade.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041318/3372590/Synergistic-integration-of-metasurfaces-and</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Universal machine learning potentials for systems with reduced dimensionality</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</link><description>We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) across systems of varying dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (3D) (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for 3D systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01–0.02 Å and errors in the energy below 10 meV atom−1 across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal MLIPs have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Conjugated polyelectrolyte-aptamer hybrid for organic-electrochemical-transistor-based sensing</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00564-8?rss=yes</link><description>Jiang et al. present biofunctionalized organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), specifically single-component materials that integrate high specificity with semiconducting properties, exemplified by p(NDI-T-ZI/EG)-aptamer.

However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design. Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and beyond with artificial intelligence.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1b20</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Molecular Modeling-Based Machine Learning for Accurate Prediction of Gas Diffusivity and Permeability in Metal–Organic Frameworks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111/asset/images/medium/mg5c00111_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Materials Au&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:15:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in PRX Energy] Dynamic Vacancy Levels in ${\mathrm{Cs}\mathrm{Pb}\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$ Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/dxmb-8s96</link><description>Author(s): Irea Mosquera-Lois and Aron Walsh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study of halide perovskites uses advanced molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning force fields to identify dynamic defect levels and their impact on the material’s optoelectronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRXENERGY/key_images/10.1103/dxmb-8s96.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[PRX Energy 4, 043008] Published Wed Nov 12, 2025</description><author>Recent Articles in PRX Energy</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/dxmb-8s96</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Accelerating Primary Screening of USP8 Inhibitors from Drug Repurposing Databases with Tree‐Based Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500108?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 04:16:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500108</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Design of simple-structured conjugated polymers for organic solar cells by machine learning-assisted structural modification and experimental validation</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00418G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00418G" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3774-3781&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00418G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shogo Tadokoro, Ryosuke Kamimura, Fumitaka Ishiwari, Akinori Saeki&lt;br /&gt;We explore simple-structured p-type polymers for organic photovoltaics using machine learning (ML) based on the primitive use of the molecular size and synthetic accessibility.

Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory database of 36 718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our zero-shot evaluation results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10–100× computational speedup. These findings fundamentally reframe MLIP development priorities: highlighting that strategic training-data generation with appropriate non-equilibrium sampling deserves equal or greater attention than architectural complexity.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1408</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Li–Si compound anodes enabling high-performance all-solid-state Li-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</link><description>Li–Si compound anodes, exemplified by Li2.33Si, overcome the degradation issues of conventional Si anodes by combining high ionic and electronic conductivity, favorable mechanical properties, and a negligible-volume-change Li-storage mechanism (Li2.33 + αSi, 0 &lt; α &lt; 0.92), thereby enabling high areal capacity, long cycle life, and fast rate capability in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Physical Chemistry Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Machine Learning as a Method for Retrieving Pressure Values by Analyzing Spectral Line Parameters: The Hydrochloric Acid Case</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097/asset/images/medium/pg5c00097_0010.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Physical Chemistry Au&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Physical Chemistry Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:09:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Near-Infrared-II Aggregation-Induced Emission Photosensitizers with Mitochondrial Respiration Perturbation Activity Amplifies Ferroptosis, Necroptosis, and Apoptosis for Cancer Immunotherapy</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202505952?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/f7af22ce-ffaa-4e3f-8d56-8d413c6d2d18/keyimage.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202505952&lt;/div&gt;Activation of programmed cell death (PCD) networks in cancer cells represents an emerging paradigm in precision oncology.

Conventional techniques are mostly invasive, time-consuming, expensive, sophisticated, and centered at urban facilities. Moreover, they are unable to address the biological complexities related to critical diseases, disorders, and pandemics, resulting in associated high morbidity and mortality. To address this gap, miniaturized fifth-generation sensing chips provide alternatives in terms of accessibility, affordability, and adaptability, being point-of-care and minimally invasive diagnostics. In this context, Breathomic chips based on nanoscale semiconductors have shown their potential for noninvasive, personalized, and on-site operation, offering the capability to identify volatile organic compounds/gases as disease biomarkers from exhaled breath and enabling early disease detection. However, the practical implementation of these sensors in real-time medical contexts remains challenging due to factors including the lack of clinical trials, dedicated data analysis, understanding of the complexities, public awareness, scalability, and accessibility. This comprehensive review critically summarizes the landscape of breath biomarkers detecting fifth-generation chemiresistive chips for human disease diagnosis, methodically outlining associated challenges, alternative strategies, and prospects for clinical implementations and commercial advancement. It details the biological origins of biomarkers, the diverse sensing modalities, and the underlying mechanisms pertaining to breathomic biomarker diagnosis. Furthermore, it highlights the integration of digital-age technologies, including nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and machine learning, for high-performance breathomic chips. These next-generation smart sensory chips have the potential to revolutionize medical healthcare facilities, improving patient outcomes, understanding prognosis, and aiding the UN's sustainable development goals.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041311/3371043/Dynamic-landscape-of-chemiresistive-breathomic</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Machine learning of polyurethane prepolymer viscosity: a comparison of chemical and physicochemical approaches</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00287G</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00287G" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3652-3661&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00287G, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Joseph A.

To address this gap, we introduce an affordable, autonomous, Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled experimental platform designed specifically for applied physics education. Utilizing an Arduino microcontroller, a customizable multi-wavelength light emitting diode array, and photosensors, our setup generates diverse, real-time optical datasets ideal for training and evaluating foundational ML algorithms, including traversal methods, Bayesian inference, and deep learning. The platform facilitates a closed-loop, self-driving experimental workflow, encompassing automated data collection, preprocessing, model training, and validation. Through systematic performance comparisons, we demonstrate the superior ability of deep learning to capture complex nonlinear relationships compared to traversal and Bayesian methods.

Yet, their success depends on robust data integration and fusion methods capable of handling materials data that are heterogeneous, sparse, and multi-scale. Such data span theoretical models, simulations, and experimental techniques across diverse spatial and temporal scales, creating significant challenges for interoperability and analysis. This perspective reviews the state-of-the-art techniques, including knowledge graphs, structured pipelines, multimodal machine learning, and physics-informed models, that are enabling materials science and SDLs to unify and learn from disparate data sources, identify critical challenges, and propose forward-looking directions to enhance data readiness, interoperability, and predictive power in SDLs. We also highlight emerging methods such as transformer architectures, zero-shot learning, and real-time stream processing, and discuss the critical need for more scalable, interpretable, and adaptive solutions to fully realize autonomous materials innovation. By mapping out both the current landscape and future opportunities, we argue that next-generation data integration and fusion are not just enablers but essential pillars for achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and intelligent SDL systems capable of addressing the complexities of hierarchical and multifunctional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/040901/3369947/Data-integration-and-data-fusion-approaches-in</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Machine learning anomaly detection of automated HPLC experiments in the cloud laboratory</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00253B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00253B" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3445-3454&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00253B, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Filipp Gusev, Benjamin C.

However, conventional approaches rely primarily on chemical and electrical doping and focus mainly on local electrical or optical measurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain.

However, their practical deployment is hindered by persistent challenges—dendritic growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), and severe volumetric expansion. Emerging as a transformative solution, three-dimensional (3D) printing enables the rational design of multiscale architectures (e.g., micro-lattice anodes and gradient-porous cathodes) and hybrid solid-state electrolytes to address these limitations. This review presents a pioneering synthesis of 3D printing's role in lithium-metal battery engineering, focusing on its capacity to regulate lithium-ion flux, stabilize SEIs, and suppress dendrite proliferation through hierarchical structural control. We systematically analyze four key additive manufacturing technologies (inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and stereolithography), delineating their unique advantages in tailoring ion transport pathways and mechanical robustness. Furthermore, we propose multi-material co-printing strategies to resolve interfacial incompatibilities in monolithic lithium-metal batteries, a critical barrier in current research. By bridging additive manufacturing with electrochemical fundamentals, this work outlines a roadmap to harness 3D printing's full potential, addressing scalability challenges and advancing applications in aerospace, wearables, and biomedical devices where energy density and safety are paramount.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041310/3369005/3D-printed-lithium-metal-batteries-Multiscale</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Harnessing Large Language Models to Advance Microbiome Research: From Sequence Analysis to Clinical Applications</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500038?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:48:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500038</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] GoFlow: efficient transition state geometry prediction with flow matching and E(3)-equivariant neural networks</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00283D</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00283D" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3492-3501&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00283D, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leonard Galustian, Konstantin Mark, Johannes Karwounopoulos, Maximilian P.-P.

The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form being used as independent loss components (here , where n is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant ). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, , for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian J. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1117</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] SpectroGen: A physically informed generative artificial intelligence for accelerated cross-modality spectroscopic materials characterization</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00477-1?rss=yes</link><description>SpectroGen seamlessly couples physics-driven distribution models with a variable autoencoder to generate synthetic spectra indistinguishable from real data.

In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041305/3366934/The-enduring-legacy-of-scanning-spreading</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Oxygen Vacancy-Modulated Molybdenum Oxide/Montmorillonite Heterointerface Nanoarchitectures for Plasmon-Enhanced Solar-Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/762823f9-fd0a-4aff-acde-289220f569a8/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132&lt;/div&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes with precise ion transport kinetics hold transformative potential for next-generation ion-selective membranes, yet their practical implementation in osmotic energy conversion remains constrained by inherent ...</description><author>Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Constructing and explaining machine learning models for the exploration and design of boron-based Lewis acids</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00212E</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00212E" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;,3623-3634&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00212E, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Juliette Fenogli, Laurence Grimaud, Rodolphe Vuilleumier&lt;br /&gt;Bridging ML and chemical intuition, interpretable models predict Lewis acidity with high accuracy and reveal design rules for tailoring boron-based Lewis acids.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00212E</guid></item><item><title>[APL Machine Learning Current Issue] Deep learning model of myofilament cooperative activation and cross-bridge cycling in cardiac muscle</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046101/3365811/Deep-learning-model-of-myofilament-cooperative</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Cardiac muscle contraction is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, where myosin heads generate force by cyclically attaching to and pulling on actin filaments using energy from ATP. Modeling this process is central to understanding cardiac sarcomere mechanics. In this study, we developed supervised machine learning (ML) models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate cross-bridge cycling and muscle behavior under isosarcometric, isometric, and isotonic conditions. Trained on synthetic data, the ANN captured nonlinear dependencies among calcium concentration, stiffness, sarcomere length, temperature, and force output. Error analysis through histograms and unity-line scatterplots validated prediction accuracy and identified underfitting and overfitting patterns. Comparisons across ANN architectures showed how hidden layer complexity affects model generalization. The present deep learning models accurately reproduced key physiological behaviors, including steady-state force–Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; relations, sarcomere length changes, and force–velocity relations, and matched theoretical results.

These natural carriers deliver various molecules into cells, including proteins and nucleic acids. There are numerous methods to load and modify EVs, encompassing physical, chemical, and biological approaches. EVs demonstrate the capacity to target specific cells within organs, even requiring blood–tissue transition. The protein corona significantly influences EV availability and cargo delivery, with biomolecules residing both within and conjugated to the EV membrane. Furthermore, embedding EVs within biomaterials such as hydrogels, scaffolds, and nanofibers can enhance their stability, targeting specificity, and therapeutic potential. By addressing cargo loading and cell/tissue-specific targeting, EVs offer a novel therapeutic strategy for various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, EVs show promise as vaccination tools, delivering messenger RNA and proteins of various pathogens. Advances in EV biology and engineering would provide improved strategies for vesicle targeting, enhanced cargo loading, and safe and effective delivery.

Our method suppresses periodic self‐interactions via supercell expansion, builds a continuous potential energy surface (PES) from MLFF energies on a spatial grid, and extracts minimum‐energy pathways without predefined nudged elastic band (NEB) images. For a benchmark set of twelve electrode and electrolyte materials, including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li10GeP2S12, our MLFF‐derived barriers lie within tens of meV of density functional theory (DFT) and experiment values, while achieving a ∼100-fold speedup over standard DFT‐NEB calculations. We benchmark GPTFF, CHGNet, and MACE, showing that fine‐tuning on PBE/PBE + U data further enhances accuracy. Ultimately, we introduce an open‐source package for high‐throughput materials screening and interactive PES visualization.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae0808</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Artificial Intelligence‐Driven Insights into Electrospinning: Machine Learning Models to Predict Cotton‐Wool‐Like Structure of Electrospun Fibers</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500060?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:21:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500060</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] 4D-MISR: a unified model for low-dose super-resolution imaging via feature fusion</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae05b6</link><description>While an electron microscope offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into structure–property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of the conventional method by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution that had been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances this reconstruction with a convolutional neural network that integrates features from synthetic, multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous, semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic evaluations on representative materials demonstrate the comparable spatial resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra low-dose conditions. Our work one-step expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable method for the structural analysis of any radiation-vulnerable material.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae05b6</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in PRX Energy] Thermodynamic Modeling of Complex Solid Solutions in the $\mathrm{Lu}$-$\mathrm{H}$-$\mathrm{N}$ System via Graph Neural Network Accelerated Monte Carlo Simulations</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/bsxd-qtph</link><description>Author(s): Pin-Wen Guan, Catalin D.
