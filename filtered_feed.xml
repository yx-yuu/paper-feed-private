Abstract: Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Chemically Grounded Evaluation Framework for Generative Models in Materials Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00886</link><description>arXiv:2601.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link><description>arXiv:2601.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Coherent B2 Stability in Ru-Containing Refractory Alloys Through Thermodynamic Elastic Design Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01326</link><description>arXiv:2601.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01428</link><description>arXiv:2601.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Universal Model for the Resting Potential in Nanofluidic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01536</link><description>arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anharmonic lattice dynamics study of phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal indium iodides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01766</link><description>arXiv:2601.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium iodides, which adopt layered or molecular-crystal-like arrangements depending on composition, are expected to exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity because of their heavy constituent atoms and weak In-I bonding. In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906</link><description>arXiv:2601.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Score-based diffusion models for accurate crystal-structure inpainting and reconstruction of hydrogen positions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01959</link><description>arXiv:2601.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept and FFT methods in micromechanics of composites subjected to body force with compact support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00822</link><description>arXiv:2601.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider static linear elastic composite materials (CMs) with periodic structure. The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AutoPot: Automated and massively parallelized construction of Machine-Learning Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01185</link><description>arXiv:2601.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.
  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link><description>arXiv:2601.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link><description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23783v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Identification of Critical Transitions via Flow Matching: A Scalable Generative Approach for Many-Body Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link><description>arXiv:2508.15318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching (FM) to identify critical properties in many-body systems efficiently. Using the 2D XY model as a benchmark, we demonstrate that a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, effectively generalizes across both temperature and system size. This dual generalization enables two primary applications for large-scale computational physics: (i) a rapid "train-small, predict-large" strategy to locate phase transition points for significantly larger systems ($128\times 128$) without retraining, facilitating efficient finite-size scaling analysis; and (ii) the fast generation of high-fidelity, decorrelated initial spin configurations for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, providing a robust starting point that bypasses the long thermalization times of traditional samplers. These capabilities arise from the combination of the Flow Matching framework, which learns stable probability-flow vector fields, and the inductive biases of the U-Net architecture that capture scale-invariant local correlations. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient tool for exploring the thermodynamic limit, serving as both a rapid explorer for phase boundaries and a high-performance initializer for high-precision studies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15318v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graph atomic cluster expansion for foundational machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17936</link><description>arXiv:2508.17936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials that can accurately and efficiently model a vast range of materials are critical for accelerating atomistic discovery. We introduce universal potentials based on the graph atomic cluster expansion (GRACE) framework, trained on several of the largest available materials datasets. Through comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that the GRACE models establish a new Pareto front for accuracy versus efficiency among foundational interatomic potentials. We further showcase their exceptional versatility by adapting them to specialized tasks and simpler architectures via fine-tuning and knowledge distillation, achieving high accuracy while preventing catastrophic forgetting. This work establishes GRACE as a robust and adaptable foundation for the next generation of atomistic modeling, enabling high-fidelity simulations across the periodic table.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.17936v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DeFecT-FF: Accelerated Modeling of Defects in Cd-Zn--Te-Se-S Compounds Combining High-Throughput DFT and Machine Learning Force Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23514</link><description>arXiv:2510.23514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23514v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams to rationalize the nucleation and quenchability of metastable $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05841</link><description>arXiv:2512.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ is a promising solid-state electrolyte with the highest ionic conductivity among its polymorphs. However, its formation presents a thermodynamic paradox: the $\alpha$-phase is the equilibrium phase at high temperature and transforms to the stable $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ polymorph when cooled to room temperature; however, $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ can be synthesized and quenched in a metastable state via rapid heating at relatively low temperatures. The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. This size-dependent stabilization is directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation. This work presents a generalizable framework that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic factors for understanding nucleation and phase transformation mechanisms, providing a rational strategy for the targeted synthesis of functional metastable materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05841v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linear magnetoresistance of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13475</link><description>arXiv:2512.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13475v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03131</link><description>arXiv:2504.03131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system operates as a quantum heat engine across the range of parameters considered. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.03131v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Systematic Review of Prompt Engineering Paradigms in Organic Chemistry: Mining, Prediction, and Model Architectures</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-625v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in scientific research, offering a powerful alternative to traditional, resource-intensive machine learning methods. By leveraging the vast knowledge encoded during pre-training, prompt engineering—the systematic design and optimization of input instructions—enables researchers to guide LLMs toward accurate and domain-specific outputs without updating model parameters. This review presents the first systematic examination of prompt engineering techniques within organic chemistry, focusing on two critical application areas: text mining and predictive tasks. We analyze the core paradigms of prompt engineering, including prompt design, prompt learning, and prompt tuning, and clarify terminological inconsistencies in the literature. The discussion is contextualized within the three principal LLM architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder), with an evaluation of their respective performances on chemistry-related tasks.  Furthermore, we explore practical workflows for extracting structured chemical data from texts and knowledge graphs, as well as advanced prompt strategies for reaction condition prediction, reaction optimization, and catalytic performance prediction. This review highlights the significant potential of LLM-driven prompt engineering to accelerate discovery in organic chemistry, from synthetic pathway optimization to automated literature analysis, while also addressing persistent challenges such as the limitations associated with various prompt engineering techniques and the constraints related to each related sub-task. We conclude by outlining future research directions aimed at deepening the integration of chemical knowledge with evolving AI methodologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-625v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ensemble Analyzer: An Open-Source Python Framework for Automated Conformer Ensemble Refinement</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-kq1wk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Accurate prediction of molecular properties often requires considering the full conformational ensemble rather than a single optimized structure.

Built on the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), EnAn integrates seamlessly with widely known quantum chemistry engines such as ORCA and Gaussian, providing a modular and extensible architecture that streamlines the entire pipeline.

By minimizing manual data handling and standardizing workflows, EnAn effectively manages reproducible exploration of complex conformational spaces.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-kq1wk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Electrostatic Patterning Controls Mineral Nucleation Inside Ferritin</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8bq1h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ferritin protein nanocages store iron across nearly all living organisms.  In mammals, two subtypes of ferritin exist: heavy (H) chain and light (L) chain.  They have very similar 3D structures, but each performs a slightly different role in iron mineral formation.  How sequence differences between the two subtypes affect mineral formation within the nanocages is still unclear.  Single-particle reconstruction of cryo-TEM images was used to build models of unmineralized and partially mineralized human L-chain and H-chain ferritin, which showed that subtle differences in protein structure led to changes in the location of mineral formation within ferritin.  Explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore how sequence-dependent electrostatics modulate ion transport, cluster formation, and mineral nucleation within the confined environment of human L- and H-chain apoferritin nanocages. Employing NaCl as a computational probe, we show that the internal charge distribution governs ion selectivity and nucleation pathways.  Analysis of liquid and solid ionic clusters, combined with Markov State Models (MSMs), reveals that mineralization proceeds through a two-step mechanism involving dense liquid-like precursors that crystallize homogeneously within the cavity.  These findings provide molecular insight into how ferritin sequence variability tunes confinement-driven nucleation and suggest general principles for designing biomimetic nanoreactors.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8bq1h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine Learning Prediction of Henry Coefficients of Polar and Nonpolar Gases in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Effects of Interlayer Shifts and Functionalization</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ps69l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for gas separation and carbon capture. Computational techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation can be used to predict the gas adsorption properties of COFs with high accuracy, however they are too inefficient to be deployed in a high-throughput manner for screening large COF databases. In this paper, we systematically train and evaluate a range of machine learning models for predicting the Henry coefficients for CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption in COF materials. To account for COF structural variability, we train our models on datasets that include both chemically functionalized frameworks and interlayer displaced stacking configurations. By comparing predictive performance across descriptor–model architecture combinations, we demonstrate how different models capture the key physical factors governing gas adsorption, including electrostatics, local atomic environments, and van der Waals interactions. Our results therefore provide a framework for building machine learning models for scalable, high-throughput screening of COF materials with targeted gas adsorption properties.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ps69l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Bridging the Gap: Aqueous Phase Organic Synthesis as a Foundation for Advanced Chemical and Biological Discovery</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hw4d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>For over a century, synthetic chemistry demanded the rigorous exclusion of water, relying on toxic, volatile organic solvents. This paradigm, while successful, is environmentally and economically costly. This review advocates for a fundamental shift: adopting water not just as a green solvent, but as a transformative medium that reshapes our understanding of reactivity and bridges chemistry with biology. Aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) has evolved from accidental observations to a deliberate discipline. Water’s unique properties—its high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and the hydrophobic effect—make it an active participant. This effect drives reactant aggregation and stabilizes transition states, leading to dramatic rate enhancements in pericyclic and condensation reactions. A broad range of reactions thrive in water, including classical carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions like the aldol and Diels–Alder, and modern cross-couplings (e.g., Suzuki–Miyaura) enabled by water-tolerant catalysts. Multicomponent and click chemistries are particularly powerful. Challenges like poor solubility are addressed with micellar catalysis, water-soluble ligands, and precise control of the reaction microenvironment. Beyond sustainability, APOS drives discovery, often yielding improved selectivities, new pathways, and streamlined syntheses of complex targets like pharmaceuticals. Its greatest promise lies in interfacing with biology. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as azide–alkyne cycloadditions, enable labeling and imaging in living organisms. Aqueous compatibility is essential for in situ therapeutic strategies, chemical biology, and advanced bioconjugation techniques for modifying biomolecules. The future converges with emerging technologies: machine learning to navigate complex aqueous systems, flow chemistry for scalability, and the integration of enzymatic with synthetic catalysis. This points toward a unified chemical-biological engineering paradigm. In conclusion, APOS is a mature, versatile field. It is a cornerstone of green chemistry and a critical bridge to biology, accelerating progress in medicine and materials science. Embracing water is both an environmental imperative and a strategic pathway to the next generation of scientific discovery.
Introduction: The Solvent Problem in Organic Synthesis
For generations, organic synthesis has been defined by precise control over molecular structure carried out in rigorously dried environments. Since the emergence of modern organic chemistry in the nineteenth century, water – the very medium that sustains life – has been regarded as an obstacle to chemical transformation. This long-standing assumption has shaped laboratory routines, industrial manufacturing, and chemical education, reinforcing the idea that successful synthesis depends on strict exclusion of moisture. This introduction revisits that historical mindset, evaluates its environmental and economic consequences, and presents the case for a fundamental transition toward aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) as a more suitable platform for future chemical and biological innovation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hw4d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Mechanisms of Li-Ion Transport Mediated by Li10GeP2S12 in Composite Solid Polyethylene Oxide Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00112</link><description>arXiv:2601.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering Ideal 2D Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals via Stacking and Intercalation of van der Waals Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00407</link><description>arXiv:2601.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional type-II topological semimetals (TSMs), characterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, have attracted intense interest for their unconventional electronic properties and exotic transport behaviors. However, rational design remains challenging due to the sensitivity of band tilting to lattice geometry, atomic coordination, and symmetry constraints. Here, we present a bottom-up approach to engineer ideal type-II nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) in van der Waals bilayers via atomic intercalation. Using monolayer $h$-AlN as a prototype, we show that fluorine-intercalated bilayer AlN (F@BL-AlN) hosts a symmetry-protected type-II nodal loop precisely at the Fermi level, enabled by preserved mirror symmetry ($\mathcal{M}_z$) and tailored interlayer hybridization. First-principles calculations reveal that fluorine not only tunes interlayer coupling but also aligns the Fermi energy with the nodal line, stabilizing the type-II NLSM phase. The system exhibits tunable electronic properties under external electric and strain fields and features a van Hove singularity that induces spontaneous ferromagnetism, realizing a ferromagnetic topological semimetal state. This work provides a versatile platform for designing type-II NLSMs and offers practical guidance for their experimental realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link><description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21012v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00018</link><description>arXiv:2601.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating).

A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Additive general integral equations in thermoelastic micromechanics of composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00019</link><description>arXiv:2601.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Screening of Functional Materials with Machine-Learning Potential and Transfer-Learned Regressions: Heusler Alloy Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20556</link><description>arXiv:2508.20556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and $E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy. Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also benchmark the performance of different uMLIPs, discuss the fidelity of local magnetic moment prediction, and demonstrate generalization to unseen elements via transfer learning from a universal interatomic potential.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20556v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166</link><description>arXiv:2509.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature and Pressure Dependent Vibrational Properties of Pristine and Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21810</link><description>arXiv:2512.21810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulatingthese properties remains poorly understood. We investigate the vibrational and optical properties of pristine and Antimony(Sb)-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ vacancy-ordered double perovskite through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4-273 K), high-pressure studies (0- \~30 GPa), ambient powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping improves phase purity, reducing impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine samples. Most notably, Sb-doped samples exhibit an anomalous Raman mode M$_1$ appearing exclusively below 100 K at 314-319 cm$^{-1}$, accompanied by changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. This behavior is absent in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$. While these observations suggest possible structural changes at low temperature, the origin of the M$_1$ mode remains unclear and may arise from disorder-activated vibrations, symmetry breaking, or dopant-induced local distortions. Low-temperature structural characterization is needed to confirm the nature of this transition. Photoluminescence shows broad self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm with broader FWHM in Sb-doped samples (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), consistent with enhanced structural disorder. High-pressure Raman measurements reveal continuous mode hardening to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These results demonstrate that Sb doping modulates the vibrational properties of Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, though further investigation is required to establish the underlying mechanisms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Support Vector Machine Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link><description>arXiv:2502.11153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting optimal kernels for regression in physical systems remains a challenge, often relying on trial-and-error with standard functions. In this work, we establish a mathematical correspondence between support vector machine kernels and quantum propagators, demonstrating that kernel efficacy is determined by its spectral alignment with the system's Green's function. Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels. Numerical experiments spanning electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, anharmonic oscillators, and photonic crystals demonstrate that this framework consistently performs well as long as there is an alignment with a Green's function.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11153v3</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ternary Transition Metal Oxides for Electrochemical Energy Storage: Synthesis, Advantages, Design Strategies, and Future Prospects</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) have emerged as a new class of electrode materials for high-performance energy storage systems, particularly supercapacitors (SCs) and hybrid battery-capacitor devices. This comprehensive review aims to comprehensively survey recent advances in the design, synthesis, and analysis of TTMOs-based nanostructures for supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. It begins by outlining the key concepts related to charge storage mechanisms in SC electrodes, electric double-layer capacitance (EDL), pseudocapacitive (PC), and battery-type (BT) behavior, followed by a clarification of device configurations, including symmetric SC (SSC), asymmetric SC (ASC), and hybrid SC (HSC) devices. This review then examines the fabrication strategies for TTMOs, emphasizing the impact of synthetic approaches on material morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemical performance. Special attention is given to the structure-property relationships that govern ion transport and charge storage dynamics in these materials. The influence of morphological features, including dimensionality, porosity, and hierarchical architecture, on electrochemical behavior is critically analyzed. A comparative evaluation of electrochemical matrices across various TTMO electrodes is presented, highlighting key performance and challenges. Ultimately, the review highlights emerging trends, current limitations, and future research directions that are poised to accelerate the development of next-generation TTMO materials for advanced energy storage technologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Tunable Gelation and Viscoelasticity of Lung-Tissue–Mimetic Sealant: Linking Shear History to In Situ Mechanical Performance through Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process–structure–property framework for a gelatin–tannic acid–transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning.

Using small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 °C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G′– loss modulus, G″, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G′,  from ~10⁶ to ~10⁴ Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01–1 s⁻¹) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2–3 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G′–, from ≈3.5×10³ to ≈4×10² Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism.

To unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R² ≈ 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states.

This rheology–machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes—airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination—it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Discovery of β-Sheet Peptide Assembly Codes via an Experimentally Validated Predictive Computational Platform</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deciphering the sequence codes governing ordered peptide assemblies remains challenging due to the need to explore vast sequence space with atomic resolution. Here, we present an experimentally validated computational framework combining hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics and machine learning for the discovery of β-sheet-rich amyloid-forming peptides. Through exhaustive simulations of all 8,000 tripeptides, we demonstrate that the widely used aggregation propensity (AP) is not effective in predicting β-sheet assembly. We introduce Amyloid-Like Tendency (ALT), a metric enabled by our hybrid-resolution simulations that effectively identifies cross-β architectures. Leveraging this physics-informed dataset, we further fine-tuned the Uni-Mol model to efficiently screen 160,000 tetrapeptides. Experimental validation of 46 candidates confirmed a predictive accuracy of ~85%, yielding 26 novel amyloid-forming peptides, including multiple hydrogelators. Mechanistic analysis reveals that specific sidechain stacking and central amino acid identity, beyond generic hydrophobicity, dictate ordered assembly. This establishes a scalable pipeline for the targeted design of functional peptide materials.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Continued Challenges in High-Throughput Materials Predictions: MatterGen predicts compounds from the training dataset.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>High-throughput computational tools and generative AI models aim to revolutionise materials discovery by enabling the rapid prediction of novel inorganic compounds. However, these tools face persistent challenges with modelling compounds where multiple elements occupy the same crystallographic site, often leading to misclassification of known disordered phases as new ordered compounds. Recently, Microsoft revealed MatterGen as a tool for predicting new materials. As a proof of concept, MatterGen was used to predict the novel compound TaCr2O6, which was subsequently synthesised in a disordered form as Ta1/3Cr2/3O2. However, detailed crystallographic analysis, presented in this paper, reveals that this is not a novel compound but is identical to the already known compound Ta1/2Cr1/2O2 reported in 1972 and actually included in MatterGen’s training dataset. These findings underscore the necessity of rigorous human verification in AI-assisted materials research, limiting their use for rapid and large-scale prediction of new materials. While generative models hold great promise, their effectiveness is currently limited by unresolved issues with disorder prediction and dataset validation. Improved integration with crystallographic expertise is essential to realise their full potential.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Pressure- and Temperature-Dependent Ionic Transport in Ag₄Zr₃S₈ Nanocrystal Pellets</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nanocrystal (NC)–derived solid electrolytes provide access to compositionally complex and metastable ion conductors, yet their measured transport properties are often dominated by extrinsic contact effects. We probe the coupled roles of temperature, uniaxial pressure, pellet microstructure, and electrode material on the electrochemical impedance response of Ag₄Zr₃S₈ NC pellets. Ag₄Zr₃S₈ NCs were synthesized via colloidal routes using distinct sulfur sources and consolidated into pellets with controlled surface chemistry. EIS was performed over 298–393 K and 0.43–8.67 MPa using blocking and non-blocking electrodes. Pressure-dependent Nyquist analysis shows impedance is overwhelmingly dominated by interfacial and constriction resistances, with pressure primarily reducing contact limitations rather than altering intrinsic ion transport. Temperature–pressure heat maps of the high-frequency resistance reveal thermally activated transport strongly modulated by mechanical contact and electrode compatibility. These results establish pressure-resolved impedance spectroscopy as a diagnostic framework for separating intrinsic and extrinsic transport contributions in NC-based solid electrolytes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Mechanistic Evidence for Dibutyl Phthalate as an Environmental Trigger for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02880-9?rss=yes</link><description>Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a ubiquitous pollutant, but its molecular link to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undefined.

Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5d9nq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Cellulose Coating Altered the Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Evolution of Sodium Thioantimonate Electrolyte in Solid-state Sodium Batteries: An Operando Raman Study</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) attracted increasing attention due to their improved safety and energy densities; yet electrolyte decomposition and subsequent contact loss limited the interfacial stability of ASSBs. Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC’s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte. The deep mechanistic insights unravel the exact modification needed for improved interfacial stability.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Accelerated green material and solvent discovery with chemistry- and physics-guided generative AI</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000235?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 2 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Eslam G.

The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence.  

This perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders. This framework enables a synergistic ecosystem where projects interoperate to accelerate innovation, eliminate duplication, and ensure long-term software sustainability, thereby creating durable foundations that elevate the entire molecular modeling community.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6n5lz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Tracing Lithophilic Sites: In Situ Nanovisualization of Their Migration and Degradation in All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19144</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c19144/asset/images/medium/ja5c19144_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c19144&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:23:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19144</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Metal−Organic Framework Ion Conductor‐Based Polymer Solid Electrolytes for Long‐Cycle Lithium Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202511014?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, 2 January 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:53:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202511014</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Regulating Interface Chemistry to Construct a Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Long‐Life Zinc Metal Anodes</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202511310?af=R</link><description>Small, Volume 22, Issue 1, 2 January 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:26:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202511310</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Here we report a full enumeration and computational exploration of this space. Density functional theory-based geometry optimisation and energy calculations have identified all stable molecules within this space, forming a new database called CHX8. A universal strain value has been proposed and assigned to each of these molecules, acting as a proxy for synthesisability and providing a clear guideline of how synthetically plausible these molecules could be. This paper explores the limits of chemical space with CHX8, with a focus on trans-fused, unsaturated and anti-Bredt ring systems. We show that, contrary to prevailing wisdom, most of these unconventional structures should be synthetically accessible, with relative strain energies less than that of cubane. It is expected that this dataset will inspire the synthesis of many new molecules with applications in various areas of chemistry, biology and materials science. The resulting dataset also provides a valuable resource for the development of general and robust machine learning models.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qjr5r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A round-robin exercise for the precise prediction of aqueous solubility of organic chemicals using chemometric, machine learning, and stacking ensemble of deep learning models</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Aqueous solubility is an important property for assessing the druggability and ecotoxicological effects of molecules. Successful drug candidates should have optimal aqueous solubility to improve bioavailability to target tissues. To effectively screen molecules in a short period of time, reliable predictive models are highly useful. In the present study, we conducted a round-robin exercise using a large, curated dataset of over 6000 compounds to predict aqueous solubility quantitatively. The six participating groups used an array of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to develop models with strong robustness and external predictive performance. All the models underwent rigorous Leave-One-Out and 10-fold cross-validation. The diversity of training sets and descriptor types used by different groups paved the way for exploring the mechanistic basis for the efficient identification of contributing features. The best-performing model was selected using the statistical Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach, considering the performances on training, cross-validation, and test, as well as the performance difference between the training and test sets. Additionally, a curated, true external set was screened by the six different models. Here, the best-performing model was selected using a consensus ranking strategy based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R_Ext^2. In both approaches, i.e., the inherent model performance in terms of training, test, and cross-validation statistics, and the ability of the model to efficiently predict true external data, the Stacking Ensemble of Deep q-RASPR model emerged as the winner. This model showed comparable predictive performance to the previously reported model, which apparently lacked a proper data curation workflow and contained a significant number of duplicates and mixtures in its dataset, which can inflate model statistics. The insights from the different feature contributions from the different groups identified the useful structural and physicochemical aspects, which can help synthetic chemists to optimize molecules.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Seeing the unseen: Real-time tracking of battery cycling-to-failure via surface strain</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</link><description>This study proposes a strain-based approach to address passive failures in lithium-ion batteries, which present spontaneous safety risks often indistinguishable from routine degradation using conventional diagnostics. By establishing a strain-failure correlation, we introduce a slope-based threshold and a failure-proximity index to characterize degradation-to-failure transitions. Incorporating strain-informed machine learning, it effectively detects early failure onset and estimates proximity. This scalable approach is suitable for real-time, onboard monitoring, supporting safer and more reliable battery operation.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Understanding and Mitigating Lithium Metal Anode Failure in All-Solid-State Batteries with Inorganic Solid Electrolytes</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333/asset/images/medium/nz5c03333_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 18:39:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Computational Materials Science] Accelerating the search for superconductors using machine learning</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025625007967?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Computational Materials Science, Volume 263&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Suhas Adiga, Umesh V.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects. These observed electronic states are all linked to the underlying alternating spin texture. Our work provides the foundational real-space evidence for altermagnetism, moving the field from theoretical and momentum-space probes to direct visual confirmation; thereby opening a path to explore how this unconventional magnetic order couples to and controls other quantum electronic states.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24114v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Upscaling from ab initio atomistic simulations to electrode scale: The case of manganese hexacyanoferrate, a cathode material for Na-ion batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24816</link><description>arXiv:2512.24816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SSCHA-based evolutionary crystal structure prediction at finite temperatures with account for quantum nuclear motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24849</link><description>arXiv:2512.24849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) at finite temperatures with quantum anharmonic effects remains challenging but very prominent in systems with lightweight atoms such as superconducting hydrides. In this work, we integrate machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) to enable evolutionary CSP on the quantum anharmonic free-energy landscape. Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project. We demonstrate that AL-MLIPs allow to correctly predict the experimentally known cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m phase as the most stable polymorph at 150 GPa but require corrections within the thermodynamic perturbation theory to get consistent results. The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP. The proposed approach extends the reach of CSP to systems where quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity dominate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Large language models and the entropy of English</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969</link><description>arXiv:2512.24969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of 3D Superconformal Ising Criticality on the Fuzzy Sphere</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25054</link><description>arXiv:2512.25054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link><description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link><description>arXiv:2512.23880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of First-Principles Methods in Modeling the Melting Properties of Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23940</link><description>arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Testing Noise Correlations by an AI-Assisted Two-Qubit Quantum Sensor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24135</link><description>arXiv:2512.24135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and validate a machine learning-assisted protocol to classify time and space correlations of classical noise acting on a quantum system, using two interacting qubits as probe. We consider different classes of noise, according to their Markovianity and spatial correlations.

Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic breaking of axial symmetry of acoustic waves in crystals as the origin of nonlinear elasticity and chaos: Analytical model and MD simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04175</link><description>arXiv:2510.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in orientated FCC crystals. A force of dynamic origin is found that is perpendicular to the direction of the external shear pressure. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in the motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic 3D potential for interaction between crystallographic layers. The potential is found to possess a component that has an anharmonic threefold axial symmetry around one direction. It reduces to the H{\'e}non-Heinen potential in a 2D cross-section, leading to mathematically rich, complex dynamic features. Results of simulation predict displacements of atoms that are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity that may have been overlooked in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link><description>arXiv:2510.18325v4 Announce Type: replace

By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18325v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Phase Stability, Structural, Mechanical, Optoelectronic, and Thermoelectric Properties of the III-V Semiconductor AlSb for Energy Conversion Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22277</link><description>arXiv:2512.22277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22277v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614</link><description>arXiv:2508.16614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 8.78% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.21%) and MatterGen (3.66%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16614v3</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Machine Learning‐Augmented Piezoelectric‐Ferroelectret Nanogenerators for Highly Sensitive Respiration Monitoring in Wearable Healthcare</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202522897?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:25:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202522897</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Ultralong‐Cycling‐Life Sodium Metal Capacitors Enabled by Hetero‐Salt Additive Strategy with NaF/LiF Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202525494?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:54:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202525494</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Challenges in Transitioning from Pellet to Practical Argyrodite-Based All-Solid-State Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368/asset/images/medium/nz5c03368_0004.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:54:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents] Machine Learning–Guided Solvation Engineering of Chiral Viologens for Durable Neutral Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202522442?af=R</link><description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:56:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/anie.202522442</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Domain oriented universal machine learning potential enables fast exploration of chemical space of battery electrolytes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67982-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 31 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67982-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67982-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Efficient modeling of battery electrolytes is limited by the accuracy-cost trade-off.

Anion Exchange Membranes for Water 
Electrolysis to Generate Green Hydrogen</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5jcw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have received a lot of attention in electrochemical energy storage 
and conversion systems and have become a better choice to generate green hydrogen than their proton 
exchange membrane counterparts owing to the non-acidic working conditions as well as the use of nonprecious metal catalytic electrodes. Albeit the safe operating conditions as well as the use of non-precious 
metals, the ion conductivity and technology readiness level of AEMs are significantly lower than their PEM 
counterparts. It is well accepted that the key factors that drive their performance are anion conductivity, 
water uptake and chemical stability. However, there exist several other parameters that influence not 
only the KPI’s but also the overall electrochemical performance of AEMs. The objective of this study is to 
compile the various physical processes in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser and focus on 
the dominant ones that define the performance of these membranes. We further propose appropriate 
methods to predict the KPIs using multiscale approach. In this report, we elaborately discuss the abovementioned points with a note that, this area still requires substantial research and profound 
understanding from both experimental and computational point of view. In this article, a comprehensive 
review on molecular dynamics simulation methods for anion exchange membranes is extensively 
discussed. We also briefly touch upon the data analytics-based approaches to predict ion conductivity in these
membranes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-5jcw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Revealing amyloid-β peptide isoforms, including post-translationally modified species, using electrochemical profiling with a dual-electrode set-up</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are crucial biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease. The high diversity of the Aβ family provides a significant challenge for recognizing various Aβ forms, which may differ by a single amino acid or a post-translational modification. Such variation at the N-terminus of Aβ peptides leads to changes in their properties associated with typical AD biomolecular mechanisms, such as aggregation or generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, a novel method for discriminating Aβ peptides with physiologically occurring truncations and modifications at their N-termini, based on the electrochemical profiling of their Cu(II) complexes, is presented. A dual-electrode set-up incorporating both glassy carbon and gold electrodes, together with Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV), was employed to generate unique electrochemical profiles, which were subsequently analyzed using chemometric techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data exploration, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) for classification. By combining electrochemical measurements with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, we successfully differentiated the studied Aβ forms, Aβ1-16, Aβ3-16, Aβpyr3-16, Aβ4-16, Aβ5-16, Aβ11-16, and Aβpyr11-16. The integration of machine learning not only enhances detection accuracy but also identifies subtle patterns that could support early-stage diagnostics. These findings support the ongoing development of analytical strategies that seek to improve the detection range and accuracy of Aβ peptides identification in Alzheimer’s disease research.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Sensing the Acidity of Hydrogen Bond Networks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The reactivity of hydrogen bond networks (HBNs) is critical to many chemical and biological scenarios. When the HBNs are under constraint, hydrogen bond strength and acidity are affected significantly. HBNs exhibit cooperativity, where connections formed in one part of the HBN influence its behavior elsewhere. We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry. These results enable the engineering and measurement of HBNs in confined environments with tailored acidity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Thiol-bearing tertiary alkylammonium chloride for regulation of PbI2 excess in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>One of the key strategies for record photovoltaic efficiencies in metal halide perovskite solar cells is the addition of PbI2 excess in a stoichiometric perovskite solution which controls crystallization, passivates defects and induces a preferred orientation in the perovskite layer. However, residual PbI2, typically found in the perovskite layer after crystallization, generates non-radiative recombination centres and promotes ion migration under light and heating stress, thus accelerating performance loss. To mitigate the above issues, a common strategy is the post-deposition of organic ammonium salts which interact in situ with residual PbI2. Here, we adopt a multifunctional alkylammonium salt, 2-diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride (DEAET), in which both the thiol (–SH) and protonated tertiary amine groups can strongly bind to PbI₂. Upon deposition of DEAET on top of FAPbI3 film, we show that DEAT decreases the percentage of residual PbI2 by 40% and totally eliminates Pb0. These two effects lead to enhanced radiative recombination, proving a net passivation effect, while chemical analysis (FTIR and liquid-state NMR) explains that this is due to strong interactions between tertiary protonated ammonium (-NH+) and thiol (-SH) groups of DEAT with under-coordinated Pb2+. The stabilization of FAPbI3 black phase along with the establishment of a solid barrier to impede the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite layer over time lead to enhanced operational stability for the as-fabricated solar cells. The encouraging findings of this study lay the foundation for the utilization of tertiary ammonium thiol-based salts as efficient agents for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] LAMMPS-ANI: Large Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations

In this work, the phonon dynamics, carrier transport, and TE performance of the layered SmZnSbO compound are comprehensively evaluated using first-principles calculations, machine learning interatomic potentials, Boltzmann transport theory, and the two-channel model. The coexistence of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, robust intralayer covalent bonding interactions, and rattling-like vibrations of Zn atoms synergistically induces significant lattice anharmonicity, resulting in a decreased lattice thermal conductivity (0.84 W/mK@900 K within the framework of the two-channel model) for the SmZnSbO compound. The natural quantum well architecture formed by the alternative conductive [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; layer and the insulated [Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; layer endows quasi-two-dimensional transport characteristics, enabling a high carrier mobility of 34.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs. Moreover, the multi-valley electronic band structure with an indirect bandgap of 0.80 eV simultaneously optimizes electrical conductivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;) and Seebeck coefficient (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;), resulting in an enhanced power factor.

We also show that solid-state gating effectively enhances the spin–orbit torque switching efficiency by reducing the coercive field without compromising the interface transparency. Finally, we demonstrate that gate-tunable devices can be harnessed for efficient nonvolatile memory functionality.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/262405/3375847/Magneto-ionic-control-of-perpendicular-anisotropy</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Predicting anode coatings for solid-state lithium metal batteries via first-principles thermodynamic calculations and hierarchical ion-transport algorithms</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/127/26/263904/3375845/Predicting-anode-coatings-for-solid-state-lithium</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are promising for next-generation energy storage devices due to their superior energy density and excellent safety. Among solid-state electrolytes, garnet-type Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (LLZO) exhibits a wide electrochemical window and high lithium-ion conductivity, but poor electrode contact and Li dendrite growth restrict its practical application. To address these challenges, this study explores the application of thin film coatings composed of Li&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt; = Si, Ge) at the lithium metal anode/LLZO interface. Through comprehensive first-principles thermodynamic calculations and hierarchical ion-transport algorithms, the phase stability, electrochemical stability, chemical stability, ionic transport, Li wettability, and mechanical properties of the candidate materials were systematically predicted and analyzed. Results indicate that the candidate coatings are thermodynamically stable at 0 K, with superior reduction stability against the lithium metal anode and good chemical compatibility with LLZO. Their Li-ion migration barriers are as low as 0.32 eV, enabling room-temperature ionic conductivity of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; S/cm. Moreover, the predicted works of adhesion for Li/Li&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt; = Si, Ge) are 0.99 and 0.76 J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, corresponding to the contact angles of 0° and 49.3°, indicating that metallic Li shows good wettability on Li&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt; = Si, Ge) materials.

Routine alcohol-based cleaning can be impractical on high-touch optical surfaces due to damage risk and usability concerns. Here, we present a scalable approach to transparent, mechanically robust glass surfaces by embedding materials with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ad hoc&lt;/span&gt; functionality into surface glass nanoholes. We demonstrate the concept with copper nanodisks: copper is an established antimicrobial agent, but its wear susceptibility pose challenges for use on transparent displays. Our design shields the functional material from lateral wear while allowing ion diffusion for antimicrobial efficacy. Fabrication uses only wafer-compatible, lithography-free steps: thermal dewetting of a thin silver film to create a nanosized mask; inverting it to a polymer nanoholes mask by etching the silver nanoparticles; wet etching of the glass to form nanoholes; selective copper deposition inside these holes; and liftoff of excess material. The resulting surfaces exhibit mean transmission of 80%–85% in the 380–750 nm range with haze &amp;lt;1% and minimal color shift, compared to uncoated glass. Antimicrobial efficacy, assessed against &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/span&gt; OP50 under a modified U.S. EPA protocol, shows ≈99% bacterial reduction within one hour. Abrasion tests with a crockmeter simulating finger swipes confirm that the embedded copper remains intact, with no measurable change in optical performance. This embedded design provides a scalable route to integrate antimicrobial functionality into high-touch transparent systems while preserving optical clarity and wear resistance, with potential relevance for medical, consumer, and transportation interfaces.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/121112/3375772/Lithography-free-fabrication-of-transparent</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Augmenting Large Language Models for Automated Discovery of f-Element Extractants</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Efficient separation of f-elements is a critical challenge for a wide range of emerging technologies. The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to propose new ligands and preliminarily rank their performance using a supervised machine learning model trained on experimental datasets to consider the impact of realistic experimental conditions. Promising human-approved ligands are then passed to a second automated pipeline that constructs three-dimensional metal-ligand complexes and performs quantum mechanical free energy calculations to directly assess metal selectivity. We demonstrate this approach for Am(III)/Eu(III) separations and report several newly designed ligands predicted to exhibit higher Am(III)/Eu(III) selectivity than the benchmark extractant CyMe4BTBP. This workflow accelerates computational exploration of the molecular space in this data-sparse field and provides a general strategy for the rapid generation and evaluation of novel lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) extractants.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

While recent advances in robotic droplet imaging have facilitated the collection of such datasets, experimental acquisition remains a key bottleneck. Here, we explore whether synthetic image generation can supplement or replace real data in the context of salt classification. Using Stable Diffusion with low-rank adaptation, we generate 133 000 synthetic images from as few as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 1–128 experimental images per salt across seven common inorganic solutes. Synthetic images become visually indistinguishable from real ones for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; ≥ 6; however, quantitative analysis based on 47 image metrics reveals subtle differences that vanish around &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 128. When used to train random forest, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models, synthetic data alone achieve classification accuracies of up to 90% in some low-data regimes. Synthetic augmentation offers a powerful strategy for expanding training sets and enabling image-based chemical classification in data-scarce scenarios, even if it seldom outperforms models trained on real data. The realism of synthetic images also highlights the growing need for tools that detect AI-generated scientific images to ensure data integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046112/3375778/Synthetic-images-from-generative-AI-for</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Effectiveness of Low-Dose Methylprednisolone in Treating Long COVID: A Retrospective Study</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</link><description>Long COVID is a chronic, multisystem disease with limited response to conventional treatments.

However, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ( κ) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs), including recently developed foundation models. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and HIPHIVE against density functional theory and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on  κ. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041424/3375425/Thermal-conductivity-limits-of-MoS2-and-MoSe2</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Widely Targeted Metabolomics and Machine Learning Identify Succinate as a Key Metabolite in Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02781-6?rss=yes</link><description>Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and serious complication of sepsis that leads to acute brain dysfunction and long-term cognitive impairment.

The optimized Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4 achieves a Li+ conductivity of 1.16 × 10−5 S cm−1, two orders of magnitude higher than that of analogous Li2TiF6. Combining the inherent high-voltage stability of fluoride and the excellent ionic conductivity of Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4, this material enables superior 5 V-class all-solid-state battery performance.

This study investigates the factors that make some odors more evocative than others. We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes.

Historically, manual inspections have been plagued by subjectivity, inefficiency, and restricted scalability, necessitating the development of enhanced detection algorithms. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing image processing and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and practical applicability. This strategy promotes classification stability by integrating machine learning classifiers, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, with fusion techniques such as Majority Voting and Mean Fusion. The experiments utilize Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for model evaluation to address dataset variability and deliver thorough assessments. The study’s results indicate that the suggested system surpasses existing systems in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, attaining an overall accuracy of 98.17%. The method is effective across various noise and resolution parameters, allowing for scalability in precision agriculture applications.

While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn–Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06, and can be applied to study unseen adsorbate coverages. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures.

From 1,258 curated cell death–related genes, candidates were filtered by logistic regression across cohorts, and ten machine learning algorithms were combined into 105 model configurations to derive a consensus diagnostic classifier.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02658-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] A Cost‐Effective and Scalable Machine Learning Approach for Quality Assessment of Fresh Maize Kernel Using NIR Spectroscopy</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202512750?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, Volume 12, Issue 46, December 11, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:23:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202512750</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] High‐Performance Zinc–Bromine Rechargeable Batteries Enabled by In‐Situ Formed Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202508646?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, Volume 12, Issue 46, December 11, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:23:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202508646</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Exacerbates the Advancement of Renal Fibrosis by Modulating Renal CCR2+PIRB+ Macrophages Through the ANGPTL8/PIRB/ALOX5AP Axis</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202509351?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, Volume 12, Issue 46, December 11, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:23:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202509351</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Inverse Design of Metal‐Organic Frameworks for CH4/N2 Separation Enabled by Coupled Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202513146?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, Volume 12, Issue 46, December 11, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:23:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202513146</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents] Synergistic Effect of Dual‐Functional Groups in MOF‐Modified Separators for Efficient Lithium‐Ion Transport and Polysulfide Management of Lithium‐Sulfur Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202515034?af=R</link><description>Advanced Science, Volume 12, Issue 46, December 11, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Science: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 09:23:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/advs.202515034</guid></item><item><title>[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Physical Sciences] Evaluating large language models in biomedical data science challenges through a classroom experiment</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2521062122?af=R</link><description>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 50, December 2025. &lt;br /&gt;SignificanceLarge language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in science and engineering, yet their real-world effectiveness in data analysis remains unclear.

Yet the link between sensorimotor recalibration to new physical conditions and cognitive updating of internal models remains unclear. We addressed this using altered gravity as a model system.

Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt;, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;LevelsExtractor&lt;/span&gt;, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;SourcesMapper&lt;/span&gt;, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;RTNinja&lt;/span&gt; offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046109/3373556/RTNinja-A-generalized-machine-learning-framework</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] A pilot study: Incorporating Treponema pallidum antigens into machine learning models for accurate syphilis treatment outcome assessment</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</link><description>Health informatics; disease; artificial intelligence applications</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02536-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Bathymetry of the Philippine sea with convolution neural network from multisource marine geodetic data</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02546-5?rss=yes</link><description>Earth sciences; oceanography; geodesy; machine learning</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02546-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Interpretable machine learning for urothelial cells classification and risk scoring in urine cytology</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02520-9?rss=yes</link><description>Health sciences; Cancer; Machine learning</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02520-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Machine Learning‐Assisted Second‐Order Perturbation Theory for Chemical Potential Correction Toward Hubbard U Determination</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500160?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 03:49:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500160</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Chinese Journal of Chemistry: Table of Contents] Locked Coplanar Conformation Boosts Rapid Electron/Ion Transport in Linear Polyimide Cathodes for Sodium‐Ion Storage</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cjoc.70366?af=R</link><description>Chinese Journal of Chemistry, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Chinese Journal of Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 07:33:36 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/cjoc.70366</guid></item><item><title>[APL Machine Learning Current Issue] A hybrid neural architecture: Online attosecond x-ray characterization</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046107/3373060/A-hybrid-neural-architecture-Online-attosecond-x</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The emergence of high-repetition-rate x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), such as SLAC’s LCLS-II, serves as our canonical example for autonomous controls that necessitate high-throughput diagnostics paired with streaming computational pipelines capable of single-shot analysis with extremely low latency.

We create a database of all two-generated subgroups of the symmetric group on n-objects and conduct a classification of finite simple groups among them using shallow feed-forward neural networks. We show that this neural network classifier can decipher the property of simplicity with varying accuracies depending on the features. Our neural network model leads to a natural conjecture concerning the generators of a finite simple group. We subsequently prove this conjecture. This new toy theorem comments on the necessary properties of generators of finite simple groups. We show this explicitly for a class of sporadic groups for which the result holds. Our work further makes the case for a machine motivated study of algebraic structures in pure mathematics and highlights the possibility of generating new conjectures and theorems in mathematics with the aid of machine learning.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1d98</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Taguchi–Bayesian Sampling: A Roadmap for Polymer Database Construction Toward Small Representative Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500150?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 05:00:22 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500150</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] An explainable machine learning model predicts 30-day readmission after vertebral augmentation</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02400-9?rss=yes</link><description>Orthopedics; Machine learning</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02400-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: SmartMat: Table of Contents] Machine Learning Design of Soft Magnetoresponsive Materials With Multidirectional Fields</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smm2.70051?af=R</link><description>SmartMat, Volume 6, Issue 6, December 2025.</description><author>Wiley: SmartMat: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smm2.70051</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Advancing metal organic framework and covalent organic framework design via the digital-intelligent paradigm</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00401B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00401B" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00401B, Review Article&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bing Ma, Na Qin, Qianqian Yan, Wei Zhou, Sheng Zhang, Xiao Wang, Lipiao Bao, Xing Lu&lt;br /&gt;AI and machine learning combined with multiscale simulations accelerate framework materials design.

We outline the design principles, fabrication processes, and computational challenges involved in creating quantum metasurfaces, discussing both forward and inverse design approaches. Advances in nanofabrication and intelligent optimization techniques, such as machine learning and topology optimization, have enabled the development of metasurfaces with unparalleled control over electromagnetic waves. We examine recent progress in using quantum metasurfaces for single-photon and multi-photon generation, quantum imaging, and quantum sensing, showcasing how these innovations achieve unprecedented precision and novel functionalities. Additionally, we highlight the integration of metasurfaces into quantum light manipulation, emphasizing their role in enhancing wavefront shaping and entanglement control.

The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for 3D systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01–0.02 Å and errors in the energy below 10 meV atom−1 across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal MLIPs have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1208</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] Conjugated polyelectrolyte-aptamer hybrid for organic-electrochemical-transistor-based sensing</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00564-8?rss=yes</link><description>Jiang et al. present biofunctionalized organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), specifically single-component materials that integrate high specificity with semiconducting properties, exemplified by p(NDI-T-ZI/EG)-aptamer.

However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design. Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and beyond with artificial intelligence.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1b20</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Molecular Modeling-Based Machine Learning for Accurate Prediction of Gas Diffusivity and Permeability in Metal–Organic Frameworks</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111/asset/images/medium/mg5c00111_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Materials Au&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Materials Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 18:15:35 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.5c00111</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in PRX Energy] Dynamic Vacancy Levels in ${\mathrm{Cs}\mathrm{Pb}\mathrm{Cl}}_{3}$ Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/dxmb-8s96</link><description>Author(s): Irea Mosquera-Lois and Aron Walsh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study of halide perovskites uses advanced molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning force fields to identify dynamic defect levels and their impact on the material’s optoelectronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRXENERGY/key_images/10.1103/dxmb-8s96.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[PRX Energy 4, 043008] Published Wed Nov 12, 2025</description><author>Recent Articles in PRX Energy</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/dxmb-8s96</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Accelerating Primary Screening of USP8 Inhibitors from Drug Repurposing Databases with Tree‐Based Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500108?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 04:16:54 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500108</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Entropy-guided discovery of denary trirutile antimonates for electrocatalytic chlorine evolution</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00381-2?rss=yes</link><description>Entropy-guided trirutile antimonates are developed as highly efficient catalysts for the chlorine evolution reaction.

Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory database of 36 718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our zero-shot evaluation results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10–100× computational speedup. These findings fundamentally reframe MLIP development priorities: highlighting that strategic training-data generation with appropriate non-equilibrium sampling deserves equal or greater attention than architectural complexity.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae1408</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Li–Si compound anodes enabling high-performance all-solid-state Li-ion batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</link><description>Li–Si compound anodes, exemplified by Li2.33Si, overcome the degradation issues of conventional Si anodes by combining high ionic and electronic conductivity, favorable mechanical properties, and a negligible-volume-change Li-storage mechanism (Li2.33 + αSi, 0 &lt; α &lt; 0.92), thereby enabling high areal capacity, long cycle life, and fast rate capability in all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00376-9?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Physical Chemistry Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Machine Learning as a Method for Retrieving Pressure Values by Analyzing Spectral Line Parameters: The Hydrochloric Acid Case</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097/asset/images/medium/pg5c00097_0010.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Physical Chemistry Au&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Physical Chemistry Au: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:09:10 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsphyschemau.5c00097</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Dynamic landscape of chemiresistive breathomic nanosensors based on fifth-generation chips for complex disease diagnosis and healthcare monitoring</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041311/3371043/Dynamic-landscape-of-chemiresistive-breathomic</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The growing global population is overwhelming the existing medical infrastructure, demanding a pressing need for the advancement of early-stage and point-of-care disease diagnostics. Conventional techniques are mostly invasive, time-consuming, expensive, sophisticated, and centered at urban facilities. Moreover, they are unable to address the biological complexities related to critical diseases, disorders, and pandemics, resulting in associated high morbidity and mortality. To address this gap, miniaturized fifth-generation sensing chips provide alternatives in terms of accessibility, affordability, and adaptability, being point-of-care and minimally invasive diagnostics. In this context, Breathomic chips based on nanoscale semiconductors have shown their potential for noninvasive, personalized, and on-site operation, offering the capability to identify volatile organic compounds/gases as disease biomarkers from exhaled breath and enabling early disease detection. However, the practical implementation of these sensors in real-time medical contexts remains challenging due to factors including the lack of clinical trials, dedicated data analysis, understanding of the complexities, public awareness, scalability, and accessibility. This comprehensive review critically summarizes the landscape of breath biomarkers detecting fifth-generation chemiresistive chips for human disease diagnosis, methodically outlining associated challenges, alternative strategies, and prospects for clinical implementations and commercial advancement. It details the biological origins of biomarkers, the diverse sensing modalities, and the underlying mechanisms pertaining to breathomic biomarker diagnosis. Furthermore, it highlights the integration of digital-age technologies, including nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and machine learning, for high-performance breathomic chips.

However, their practical deployment is hindered by persistent challenges—dendritic growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), and severe volumetric expansion. Emerging as a transformative solution, three-dimensional (3D) printing enables the rational design of multiscale architectures (e.g., micro-lattice anodes and gradient-porous cathodes) and hybrid solid-state electrolytes to address these limitations. This review presents a pioneering synthesis of 3D printing's role in lithium-metal battery engineering, focusing on its capacity to regulate lithium-ion flux, stabilize SEIs, and suppress dendrite proliferation through hierarchical structural control. We systematically analyze four key additive manufacturing technologies (inkjet printing, direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and stereolithography), delineating their unique advantages in tailoring ion transport pathways and mechanical robustness. Furthermore, we propose multi-material co-printing strategies to resolve interfacial incompatibilities in monolithic lithium-metal batteries, a critical barrier in current research.

This fundamental mechanism offers insights for optimizing the NRLO/sulfide solid electrolyte interface and advancing high-energy-density ASSLBs.</description><author>Chem</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(25)00366-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] Dynamic pressure mapping of infant cervical spines using a wearable magnetoelastic patch</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00529-6?rss=yes</link><description>To enable continuous monitoring of infant cervical motion, we present a kirigami-inspired soft magnetoelastic patch that conforms intimately to the cervical position without compromising comfort.

In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/12/4/041305/3366934/The-enduring-legacy-of-scanning-spreading</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Oxygen Vacancy-Modulated Molybdenum Oxide/Montmorillonite Heterointerface Nanoarchitectures for Plasmon-Enhanced Solar-Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/762823f9-fd0a-4aff-acde-289220f569a8/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132&lt;/div&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes with precise ion transport kinetics hold transformative potential for next-generation ion-selective membranes, yet their practical implementation in osmotic energy conversion remains constrained by inherent ...</description><author>Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents] Oxygen Vacancy-Modulated Molybdenum Oxide/Montmorillonite Heterointerface Nanoarchitectures for Plasmon-Enhanced Solar-Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title><link>https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com.localhost.literatumonline.com:25116/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/cms/asset/762823f9-fd0a-4aff-acde-289220f569a8/keyimage.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCS Chemistry, Ahead of Print.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI:10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132&lt;/div&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) nanofluidic membranes with precise ion transport kinetics hold transformative potential for next-generation ion-selective membranes, yet their practical implementation in osmotic energy conversion remains constrained by inherent ...</description><author>Chinese Chemical Society: CCS Chemistry: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:22:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://ccs-stag.literatumonline.com.localhost.literatumonline.com:25116/doi/abs/10.31635/ccschem.025.202506132?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[APL Machine Learning Current Issue] Deep learning model of myofilament cooperative activation and cross-bridge cycling in cardiac muscle</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046101/3365811/Deep-learning-model-of-myofilament-cooperative</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Cardiac muscle contraction is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, where myosin heads generate force by cyclically attaching to and pulling on actin filaments using energy from ATP. Modeling this process is central to understanding cardiac sarcomere mechanics. In this study, we developed supervised machine learning (ML) models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate cross-bridge cycling and muscle behavior under isosarcometric, isometric, and isotonic conditions. Trained on synthetic data, the ANN captured nonlinear dependencies among calcium concentration, stiffness, sarcomere length, temperature, and force output. Error analysis through histograms and unity-line scatterplots validated prediction accuracy and identified underfitting and overfitting patterns. Comparisons across ANN architectures showed how hidden layer complexity affects model generalization. The present deep learning models accurately reproduced key physiological behaviors, including steady-state force–Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; relations, sarcomere length changes, and force–velocity relations, and matched theoretical results. This work demonstrates the potential of ML tools to enhance cardiac muscle modeling and exploit existing experimental datasets for improved prediction of cardiac muscle diseases.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046101/3365811/Deep-learning-model-of-myofilament-cooperative</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Discovery of Novel Materials with Giant Dielectric Constants via First‐Principles Phonon Calculations and Machine Learning</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500141?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 06:30:24 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500141</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] FastTrack: a fast method to evaluate mass transport in solid leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potential</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae0808</link><description>We introduce a rapid, accurate framework for computing atomic migration barriers in crystals by combining universal machine‐learning force fields (MLFFs) with 3D potential‐energy‐surface sampling and interpolation. Our method suppresses periodic self‐interactions via supercell expansion, builds a continuous potential energy surface (PES) from MLFF energies on a spatial grid, and extracts minimum‐energy pathways without predefined nudged elastic band (NEB) images. For a benchmark set of twelve electrode and electrolyte materials, including LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li10GeP2S12, our MLFF‐derived barriers lie within tens of meV of density functional theory (DFT) and experiment values, while achieving a ∼100-fold speedup over standard DFT‐NEB calculations. We benchmark GPTFF, CHGNet, and MACE, showing that fine‐tuning on PBE/PBE + U data further enhances accuracy. Ultimately, we introduce an open‐source package for high‐throughput materials screening and interactive PES visualization.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae0808</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents] Artificial Intelligence‐Driven Insights into Electrospinning: Machine Learning Models to Predict Cotton‐Wool‐Like Structure of Electrospun Fibers</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aidi.202500060?af=R</link><description>Advanced Intelligent Discovery, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Intelligent Discovery: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:21:08 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/aidi.202500060</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in PRX Energy] Reconstructions and Dynamics of $β$-Lithium Thiophosphate Surfaces</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/5hf9-hlj6</link><description>Author(s): Hanna Türk, Davide Tisi, and Michele Ceriotti&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine-learning-based molecular dynamics simulations of the solid electrolyte &lt;math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;mi&gt;β&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;-Li&lt;math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;3&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/math&gt;PS&lt;math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/math&gt; under realistic conditions reveal dynamic surface structure and reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height="" src="https://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRXENERGY/key_images/10.1103/5hf9-hlj6.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[PRX Energy 4, 033010] Published Tue Aug 26, 2025</description><author>Recent Articles in PRX Energy</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/5hf9-hlj6</guid></item><item><title>[Matter] CGformer: Transformer-enhanced crystal graph network with global attention for material property prediction</title><link>https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(25)00423-0?rss=yes</link><description>Designing new materials for better batteries is a major challenge, especially for complex “high-entropy” materials with countless atomic combinations.
