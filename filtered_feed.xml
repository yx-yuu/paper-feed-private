Abstract: Li$_2$MnO$_3$ remains a crucial component of the Li-excess layered cathode family, $(1-x)\,\mathrm{LiMO_2} + x\,\mathrm{Li_2MnO_3}$ ($M$ = Mn, Ni, Co, \dots), but its role in limiting Li-ion mobility remains under debate. Here we combine DFT+$U$, finite-temperature DMFT with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver, and nudged-elastic-band (NEB) calculations to investigate Li$^+$ migration for a single Li vacancy in paramagnetic Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Dynamical electronic correlations within DMFT substantially reduce the activation energies of the lowest-barrier pathways, yielding $E_a = 0.18$ eV for the shortest-range Li jump and $E_a = 0.50$ eV for the next-lowest pathway. The 0.18 eV barrier quantitatively reproduces the short-range activation energy extracted from $\mu^+$SR measurements, whereas the 0.50 eV barrier is consistent with the long-range transport activation energy obtained from ac-impedance measurements. This single-vacancy, paramagnetic DMFT description therefore provides a coherent explanation of both local and macroscopic probes without requiring highly clustered vacancy configurations or strong extrinsic disorder, an assumption compatible with nearly stoichiometric Li$_2$MnO$_3$ powders. Our results highlight the importance of finite-temperature dynamical correlations for Li-ion migration in correlated oxides and provide a framework for incorporating strong Coulomb interactions in future studies of transition-metal oxide battery materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal conductivity in noncollinear magnets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03326</link><description>arXiv:2602.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic memory and logic devices, including prospective ones based on skyrmions, inevitably produce heat. Thus, controlling heat flow is essential for their performance. Here we study how non-collinear spin arrangement affects the magnon contribution to thermal conductivity. As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments. The results provide the blueprint for calculating magnetic thermal transport in non-collinear magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accelerating Complex Materials Discovery with Universal Machine-Learning Potential-Driven Structure Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03369</link><description>arXiv:2602.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have become powerful tools for accelerating computational materials discovery by replacing expensive first-principles calculations in crystal structure prediction (CSP). However, their effectiveness in identifying new, complex materials remains uncertain. Here, we systematically assess the capability of a uMLIP (i.e.,M3GNet) to accelerate CSP in quaternary oxides. Through extensive exploration of the Sr-Li-Al-O and Ba-Y-Al-O systems, we show that uMLIP can rediscover experimentally known materials absent from its training set and identify seven new thermodynamically and dynamically stable compounds. These include a new polymorph of Sr2LiAlO4 (P3221) and a new disordered phase, Sr2Li4Al2O7 (P1_bar). Furthermore, our results show stability predictions based on the semilocal PBE functional require cross-validation with higher-level methods, such as SCAN and RPA, to ensure reliability. While uMLIPs substantially reduce the computational cost of CSP, the primary bottleneck has shifted to the efficiency of search algorithms in navigating complex structural spaces. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of uMLIP-driven CSP in the discovery of new materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03369v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Acceleration of Atomistic NEGF: Algorithms, Parallelization, and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03438</link><description>arXiv:2602.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a particularly powerful method to simulate the quantum transport properties of nanoscale devices such as transistors, photo-diodes, or memory cells, in the ballistic limit of transport or in the presence of various scattering sources such as electronphonon, electron-photon, or even electron-electron interactions. The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms. Also, the accuracy of the models has kept improving, from empirical to fully ab-initio ones, e.g., density functional theory (DFT). This paper summarizes key (algorithmic) achievements that have allowed us to bring DFT+NEGF simulations closer to the dimensions and functionality of realistic systems. The possibility of leveraging graph neural networks and machine learning to speed up ab-initio device simulations is discussed as well.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03438v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Modeling of Charge-Density-Wave Recovery After Laser Melting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03761</link><description>arXiv:2602.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-pumped two-dimensional spinless Holstein model within a semiclassical framework, focusing on the melting and recovery of long-range charge-density-wave order. Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03761v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning ORDER-Aware Multimodal Representations for Composite Materials Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02513</link><description>arXiv:2602.02513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown remarkable success in materials discovery and property prediction, particularly for crystalline and polymer systems where material properties and structures are dominated by discrete graph representations. Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02513v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] How to Train Your Resistive Network: Generalized Equilibrium Propagation and Analytical Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03546</link><description>arXiv:2602.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful method of extracting meaning from data; unfortunately, current digital hardware is extremely energy-intensive. There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03546v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link><description>arXiv:2506.08112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08112v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Opposite impact of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity on the phonon-limited resistivity of elemental metals from first principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17478</link><description>arXiv:2511.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding electrical resistivity in metals remains a central challenge in quantifying charge transport at finite temperature. Current first-principles calculations based on the Boltzmann transport equation often match experiments, yet they almost always neglect the effect of thermal expansion and phonon anharmonicity. We show that both effects exert an opposite impact on electron-phonon coupling and on electrical resistivity. Thermal expansion enhances the coupling and leads to overestimation of resistivity, whereas anharmonic effects reduce it. By explicitly incorporating both effects, we establish a more complete description of resistivity in elemental metals, demonstrated here for Pb, Nb, and Al.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.17478v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link><description>arXiv:2601.09705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09705v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing Strain Effects on the Graphene-Water Contact Angle Using a Machine Learning Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20134</link><description>arXiv:2601.20134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how water wets graphene is critical for predicting and controlling its behavior in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications. A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \pm 1.5 \deg$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet "surfs", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20134v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modelling Realistic Multi-layer devices for superconducting quantum electronic circuits</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02178</link><description>arXiv:2411.02178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical model specifically designed for 3D multilayer devices, with a focus on nanobridge junctions and coplanar waveguides. Unlike existing numerical models, ours does not approximate the physical layout or limit the number of constituent materials, providing a more accurate and flexible design tool. We calculate critical currents, current phase relationships, and the energy gap where relevant. We validate our model by comparing it with published data. Through our analysis, we found that using multilayer films significantly enhances control over these quantities. For nanobridge junctions in particular, multilayer structures improve qubit anharmonicity compared to monolayer junctions, offering a substantial advantage for qubit performance. For coated multilayer microwave circuits it allows for better studies of the proximity effect, including their effective kinetic inductance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02178v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link><description>arXiv:2505.12387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12387v4</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Customized composition of lithium metal solid-electrolyte interphase by electric field modulation of anion motion direction</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68498-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 04 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68498-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68498-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;High-voltage lithium-metal batteries face safety and stability challenges.

Abstract: We present an integrated multiagent AI ecosystem for polymer discovery that unifies high-throughput materials workflows, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling within a single Polymer Research Lifecycle (PRL) pipeline. The system orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-of-the-art large language models (DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-Coder) to retrieve and reason over scientific resources, invoke external tools, execute domain-specific code, and perform metacognitive self-assessment for robust end-to-end task execution. We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66). We further demonstrate metacognitive control in a polystyrene case study, where the system not only produces domain-level scientific outputs but continually monitors and optimizes its own behavior through tactical, strategic, and meta-strategic self-assessment.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00169</link><description>arXiv:2602.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00169v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] QUASAR: A Universal Autonomous System for Atomistic Simulation and a Benchmark of Its Capabilities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00185</link><description>arXiv:2602.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into materials science offers a transformative opportunity to streamline computational workflows, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling approaches and narrowly scoped agents. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a universal autonomous system for atomistic simulation designed to facilitate production-grade scientific discovery. QUASAR autonomously orchestrates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient memory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screening and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework. They also provide initial evidence supporting the potential deployment of agentic AI as a component of computational chemistry research workflows, while identifying areas requiring further development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning to Predict Spectral Anisotropy in Valence-to-Core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00242</link><description>arXiv:2602.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00242v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interatomic potentials for platinum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00379</link><description>arXiv:2602.00379v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Bimetallic catalysts provide new routes toward sustainable ammonia synthesis, but the structural dynamics controlling their performance under real-world conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (&gt;450 {\deg}C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Synergistic effect of the electronic band delocalization and bond anharmonicity on the thermoelectric performance of Cs2TeX6(X=Cl, Br, I)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00562</link><description>arXiv:2602.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of lead-free double halide perovskites Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The HSE06 band gap is incorporated using the scissor correction method along with PBE calculated electronic band structures including spin orbit coupling to accurately predict transport properties. The band gap values are 3.27, 2.50, and 1.55 eV for Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. The coexistence of heavy and light bands in the Cs2TeI6 band structure helps mitigate the trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Among these systems, Cs2TeI6 exhibits superior performance with a ZT of 1.97 at 800 K and an electronic concentration of 3.35 x 10^19 cm^-3. Such a high ZT at relatively low carrier concentration arises from high electrical conductivity combined with low lattice thermal conductivity. The lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2TeI6 is found to be 0.41 W m^-1 K^-1 at room temperature. This low lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to weak Te-I bonding and non-uniform out-of-phase displacement of Cs atoms. The presence of local TeX6 units together with weak bonds strongly resists heat conduction, leading to significant suppression of lattice thermal conductivity. In particular, transverse acoustic phonons and optical phonons play a key role in limiting lattice thermal conductivity. These results identify Cs2TeI6 as a promising candidate for high performance thermoelectric applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00562v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Machine Learning for Integrating Heterogeneous Analytical Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00590</link><description>arXiv:2602.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00590v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Van Hove singularity-induced multiple magnetic transitions in multi-orbital systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00698</link><description>arXiv:2602.00698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (VHSs) amplify electronic correlations, providing a crucial platform for discovering novel quantum phase transitions. Here, we show that VHSs in multi-orbital systems can stabilize a variety of competing $\bm{Q}=0$ magnetic orders, including intrinsic altermagnetism emerging from spontaneous orbital antiferromagnetism. This intrinsic phase, in which antiparallel spins reside on distinct orbitals, is realized across all four 2D Bravais lattices. It is driven by orbital-resolved spin fluctuations enhanced by inter-orbital hopping and favors suppressed Hund's coupling $J_H$, strong inter-orbital hybridization, and filling near a VHS from quadratic band touching. Through Hubbard-$U$-$J_H$ phase diagrams we map several magnetic phase transitions: (i) ferrimagnet to $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet, (ii) $d$-wave intrinsic altermagnet to ferromagnet, and (iii) $g$-wave extrinsic altermagnet to either $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet or ferromagnet. Our work identifies VHSs as a generic route to altermagnetism in correlated materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00698v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A New Workflow for Materials Discovery Bridging the Gap Between Experimental Databases and Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00756</link><description>arXiv:2602.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating Machine Learning (ML) into material property prediction has become a crucial step in accelerating materials discovery. A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00756v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An Open-Source Framework for Measurement and Analysis of Nanoscale Ionic Transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00806</link><description>arXiv:2602.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanofluidic systems exploit nanometre-scale confinement in channels and pores to regulate ionic transport, enabling functionalities such as osmotic energy harvesting and neuromorphic ionic memory. Studying such confined transport requires both precise electrical instrumentation and careful data analysis, yet, in practice, measurements are still often taken with vendor software, exported as files, and processed later in separate environments. In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation. All three GUIs are implemented in Python/Tkinter with modular plotting and logging layers so that flexible control sequences and physics-based post-processing share a common data format, improving reproducibility, timing stability and day-to-day efficiency in nanofluidic and electronic device studies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00806v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Robust Machine Learning Framework for Reliable Discovery of High-Performance Half-Heusler Thermoelectrics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01149</link><description>arXiv:2602.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can facilitate efficient thermoelectric (TE) material discovery essential to address the environmental crisis. However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01149v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AI Meets Plasticity: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01215</link><description>arXiv:2602.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a new paradigm of scientific discovery, namely data-driven science, across nearly all scientific disciplines. In materials science and engineering, AI has already begun to exert a transformative influence, making it both timely and necessary to examine its interaction with materials plasticity. In this study, we present a holistic survey of the convergence between AI and plasticity, highlighting state-of-the-art AI methodologies employed to discover, construct surrogate models for, and emulate the plastic behavior of materials. From a materials science perspective, we examine cause-and-effect relationships governing plastic deformation, including microstructural characterization and macroscopic responses described through plasticity constitutive models. From the perspective of AI methodology, we review a broad spectrum of applied approaches, ranging from frequentist techniques such as classical machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed models to probabilistic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty quantification and generative AI methods. These data-driven approaches are discussed in the context of materials characterization and plasticity-related applications. The primary objective of this survey is to develop a comprehensive and well-organized taxonomy grounded in AI methodologies, with particular emphasis on distinguishing critical aspects of these techniques, including model architectures, data requirements, and predictive performance within the specific domain of materials plasticity. By doing so, this work aims to provide a clear road map for researchers and practitioners in the materials community, while offering deeper physical insight and intuition into the role of AI in advancing materials plasticity and characterization, an area of growing importance in the emerging AI-driven era.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01215v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards knowledge-based workflows: a semantic approach to atomistic simulations for mechanical and thermodynamic properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01358</link><description>arXiv:2602.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical and thermodynamic properties, including the influence of crystal defects, are critical for evaluating materials in engineering applications. Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insight into these mechanisms at the atomic scale. However, current practice often relies on fragmented scripts with inconsistent metadata and limited provenance, which hinders reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse. FAIR data principles and workflow-based approaches offer a path to address these limitations. We present reusable atomistic workflows that incorporate metadata annotation aligned with application ontologies, enabling automatic provenance capture and FAIR-compliant data outputs. The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework. The approach provides AI-ready simulation data, supports emerging agentic AI workflows, and establishes a generalizable blueprint for knowledge-based mechanical and thermodynamic simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01358v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Predictive Modeling of Illumination-Dependent Current-Voltage Curves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01859</link><description>arXiv:2602.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01859v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermophysical properties of spark plasma sintered UCo: a comparison with machine learning predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01896</link><description>arXiv:2602.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium dioxide has been widely used as a nuclear fuel in commercial light water reactors due to its high uranium density and chemical stability. However, its relatively low thermal conductivity is not optimal from the viewpoints of fuel integrity and safety margins, particularly during loss-of-coolant accidents. Although the development of accident-tolerant fuels with higher thermal conductivity is strongly desired, many potential uranium compounds remain unexplored due to constraints associated with handling radioactive materials. To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of UCo predicted by machine learning is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite slight discrepancies, additional SHAP analysis suggests that the model's decision logic is consistent with known physical trends. Overall, this study fills a gap in reported thermophysical properties of UCo and provides experimental support for machine-learning-assisted screening of uranium compounds relevant to advanced fuel development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01896v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Putting machine learning to the test in a quantum many-body system</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01981</link><description>arXiv:2602.01981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01981v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Triplet Envelope Functions for increasing machine learning interatomic potential efficiency and stability</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02228</link><description>arXiv:2602.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02228v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-restricted energy landscapes as a benchmark for machine learned interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02237</link><description>arXiv:2602.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02237v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nonlinear light cone spreading of correlations in a triangular quantum magnet: a hard quantum simulation target</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02433</link><description>arXiv:2602.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical correlations of quantum many-body systems are typically analyzed in the momentum space and frequency basis. However, quantum simulators operate more naturally in real space, real time settings. Here we analyze the real-space time-dependent van Hove spin correlations $G(r,t)$ of the 2D triangular antiferromagnet KYbSe$_2$ as obtained from high-resolution Fourier-transformed neutron spectroscopy. We compare this to $G(r,t)$ from five theoretical simulations of the well-established spin Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals non-linear sub-ballistic low-temperature transport in KYbSe$_2$ which none of the current state-of-the-art numerical or field-theoretical methods reproduce. Our observation signals an emergent collective hydrodynamics, perhaps associated with the quantum critical phase of a quantum spin liquid, and provides an ideal benchmark for future quantum simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02433v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Open Materials Generation with Inference-Time Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00424</link><description>arXiv:2602.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time generative models for crystalline materials enable inverse materials design by learning to predict stable crystal structures, but incorporating explicit target properties into the generative process remains challenging. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics Informed Generative AI Enabling Labour Free Segmentation For Microscopy Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01710</link><description>arXiv:2602.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01710v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning determines the Mg2SiO4 P-T phase diagram</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01730</link><description>arXiv:2602.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions among Mg2SiO4 and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) are central to mantle dynamics and deep-mantle material cycling. However, the locations and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) dependences of these phase boundaries remain debated, largely due to experimental limitations at extreme conditions and the high computational cost of first-principles free-energy calculations. Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01730v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10358</link><description>arXiv:2505.10358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order Van Hove singularities in strongly correlated electron systems provide a fertile ground for emergent electronic orders and superconductivity. This study investigates the interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities on the honeycomb lattice, a paradigmatic platform relevant to graphene. By incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \(t''\), we uncover a universal crossover: ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate below the higher-order Van Hove filling, while antiferromagnetic fluctuations take over toward half filling. A key finding is that the already dominant \(f_n\)-wave pairing is enhanced in the critical region of this magnetic crossover by the higher-order Van Hove. This enhancement is driven by the synergistic effect of the higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states and the competing magnetic fluctuations. Although increased hopping parameters generally suppress superconducting correlation, we identify a critical \(t''\) that anomalously enhances pairing via the higher-order Van Hove renormalization. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction suppresses the pairing correlation function in a sign-independent manner. Our results clarify the competitive mechanisms between magnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity in higher-order Van Hove singularities systems, offering a theoretical basis for tailoring quantum phases in graphene-based materials via band engineering.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.10358v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nanoconfined Grain Boundaries Increase Conductivity of Polycrystalline Molecular Crystals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12172</link><description>arXiv:2508.12172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the Adpn-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated Adpn-LiPF6 solutions (0.04M), and Li+ ions predominantly solvated by cyano groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12172v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01419</link><description>arXiv:2510.01419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01419v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Automated laboratory x-ray diffractometer and fluorescence spectrometer for high-throughput materials characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14905</link><description>arXiv:2511.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of rapidly generating large data sets. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy X-ray beam (24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows spatially-resolved (~200 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records X-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the X-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.14905v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01067</link><description>arXiv:2512.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate structural relaxation is critical for advanced materials design. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which strive to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method consistently improves performance across all evaluated pretrained models; resulting in an average of roughly 32% reduction in prediction error. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01067v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven active learning approaches for accelerating materials discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06971</link><description>arXiv:2601.06971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials discovery is a cornerstone of modern technological advancement, yet it remains constrained by traditional trial-and-error paradigms and the inherent bias of human intuition. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in materials science by effectively modeling structure-property relationships. Despite substantial efforts to enhance model expressiveness, data efficiency remains an equally critical challenge, given the limited availability of experimental and computational resources. Active learning (AL), as a data-driven machine learning paradigm, has shown great promise for discovering novel materials and enabling the efficient navigation of vast materials spaces. In this review, we follow the evolution of sampling strategy design techniques in AL, from Bayesian optimization to advanced deep learning-based strategies. We then highlight how AL enhances data efficiency across various data regimes, ranging from task-specific settings with limited data to the development of general-purpose datasets and large-scale models. We further provide a systematic overview of AL applications throughout the materials research pipeline, including computational simulation, composition and structural design, process optimization, and self-driving laboratory systems. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future perspectives of AL in materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06971v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13283</link><description>arXiv:2601.13283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13283v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DistMLIP: A Distributed Inference Platform for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02023</link><description>arXiv:2506.02023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02023v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979</link><description>arXiv:2601.16979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16979v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Convergent Discovery of Critical Phenomena Mathematics Across Disciplines: A Cross-Domain Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22389</link><description>arXiv:2601.22389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22389v2</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Lattice anharmonicity effects in fluorite oxide single crystals and anomalous increase in phonon lifetime in ceria at elevated temperature</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/051902/3378532/Lattice-anharmonicity-effects-in-fluorite-oxide</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;We investigate the temperature dependence of the frequency and linewidth of the triply degenerate T&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; zone-centered optical phonon in flux-grown ceria and hydrothermally synthesized thoria single crystals from room temperature to 1273 K using Raman spectroscopy. Both crystals exhibit an expected increase in the phonon linewidth with temperature due to enhanced phonon–phonon scattering. However, ceria displays an anomalous linewidth reduction in the temperature range of 1023–1123 K. First-principles phonon linewidth calculations considering cubic and quartic phonon interactions within temperature-independent phonon dispersion fail to describe this anomaly. A parameterization of the temperature-dependent second-order interatomic force constants based on previously reported phonon dispersion measured at room and high temperatures predicts a deviation from the monotonic linewidth increase, albeit at temperatures lower than those observed experimentally for ceria. The qualitative agreement in the trend of temperature-dependent linewidth suggests that lattice anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization plays a role in phonon lifetime. Specifically, a change in the overlap between softened acoustic and optical branches in the dispersion curve reduces the available phonon scattering phase space of the Raman-active mode at the zone center, leading to an increased phonon lifetime within a narrow temperature interval. These findings provide insights into higher-order anharmonic interactions in ceria and thoria, motivating further investigations into the role of anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization on phonon lifetimes at high temperatures.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>Applied Physics Letters Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/5/051902/3378532/Lattice-anharmonicity-effects-in-fluorite-oxide</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] From Pretrained to Precision: Fine-Tuning Universal Interatomic Potentials for Accurate Catalytic Reaction Simulations</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455/asset/images/medium/ct5c01455_0009.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:37:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01455</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Solvent Footprint in Wet-Chemical Processing of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes for All-Solid-State Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985/asset/images/medium/nz5c03985_0010.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03985</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Interpretable Machine Learning for Solid-State Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c21738</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsnano.5c21738/asset/images/medium/nn5c21738_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.5c21738&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Nano: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:53:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c21738</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Abstract: Cavity magnonics investigates hybrid systems where magnons interact coherently with photons, providing a platform to harness light-matter interaction in magnetic materials. Progress in this field hinges on achieving stronger and tunable nonlinear effects, which are essential for controlling magnon dynamics and frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate the magnon Kerr effect in an anisotropic magnonic system comprising a 200~nm-thick yttrium iron garnet film strongly coupled to a three-dimensional microwave resonator. The strong shape anisotropy significantly enhances the magnon Kerr effect compared to a sphere of equivalent volume, while the cavity enables sensitive probing of magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate continuous tunability of the magnitude and sign of the Kerr shift by controlling the static orientation of the magnetization. Input-output modeling of the magnon-photon interaction provides a consistent description of our system and Kerr coefficients matching the experimental results. Our findings demonstrate a scalable approach to enhancing Kerr anharmonicity in hybrid magnon-photon systems while preserving strong coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22271v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hydrogen in Brownmillerite Perovskites: First-Principles Insights into Energetics and Induced Electronic-Magnetic Changes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22353</link><description>arXiv:2601.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen uptake in brownmillerite perovskites A2B2O5 offers an (electro)chemically accessible route to tune functional properties, but mechanistic understanding and design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides remain limited. Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation. Together, these results establish practical design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides relevant to iono-electronic devices, sensors, and electrically tunable spin functionality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22353v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Turning Insulators into Accelerators: Deciphering the Interfacial Conductivity Boost in ZrO2-Li2ZrCl6 Composites through Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22612</link><description>arXiv:2601.22612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide solid-state electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for all-solid-state lithium batteries due to their high oxidative stability and deformability, yet their moderate ionic conductivity remains a bottleneck. While incorporating ionically insulating ZrO2 nanoparticles (Nat. Commun. 2023, 14, 2459) has been experimentally shown to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6, the atomistic origin governing this interfacial phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we bridge the spatiotemporal gap in modeling complex heterostructures by developing an accurate machine-learned force fields based on neuroevolution potential, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 heterostructures. By systematically investigating four representative low-lattice-mismatch ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 interfaces, we identify spontaneous interfacial amorphization driven by space-charge effects upon surface cleavage, trapping Li+ and leading to under-coordinated Li+ polyhedrons with pronounced geometric distortion. These distorted amorphous interfacial regions exhibit markedly enhanced Li+ hopping activity, significantly outperforming the bulk lattice, provided that local mobile Li+ inventory is not depleted by surface charge redistribution. This work establishes a computational framework for training validated machine-learned force fields for interfaces and provides mechanistic understandings of the interfacial conductivity boost in the insulator-conductor composites, guiding the rational design of electrolytes toward next-generation solid-state batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22612v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Incorporating Gibbs free energy into interatomic potential fitting</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22671</link><description>arXiv:2601.22671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to fit high-temperature Gibbs free energy data for the development of interatomic potentials for atomic systems. The approach is based on Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration, enabling the identification of suitable potential parameters such that the system's free energy matches a specified target. The method can be readily combined with conventional fitting techniques for properties such as elastic tensors and liquid pair distribution functions. We validate the effectiveness of the approach using the Uhlenbeck-Ford model and embedded-atom method potentials for pure Ni phases and binary Fe1-xOx liquids under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. Our framework provides an efficient strategy for incorporating free energy into interatomic potential fitting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22671v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SpinWaveToolkit: Python package for (semi-)analytical calculations in the field of spin-wave physics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23227</link><description>arXiv:2601.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python package, SpinWaveToolkit (SWT), for (semi-)analytical modeling of spin-wave dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films and exchange-coupled magnetic bilayers. SWT combines analytical models based on the Kalinikos-Slavin theory with a semi-analytical dynamic-matrix approach, enabling the calculation of dispersion relations, group velocities, decay lengths, mode profiles, and static equilibrium magnetization states. In addition, SWT implements a quantitative model of micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) that incorporates vectorial optical focusing, spin-wave Bloch functions, magneto-optical coupling, and Green-function propagation to simulate experimentally measured BLS spectra. The package is validated against finite-element dynamic-matrix simulations performed with TetraX for Damon-Eshbach, backward-volume, forward-volume, and oblique-field geometries, showing excellent agreement while reducing computation times by nearly two orders of magnitude in comparison to the numerical simulations. Thanks to the easiness of the use and fast calculation times, SWT can be used not only for exploratory mapping of the parameter space, but also for the fitting of the measured dispersion relations and related parameters. Thus, it provides a versatile and efficient framework for experiment design, interpretation, and parameter optimization for magnonics research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23227v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22173</link><description>arXiv:2601.22173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22173v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22312</link><description>arXiv:2601.22312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

Abstract: Techniques for detecting critical phenomena -- phase transitions where correlation length diverges and small perturbations have large effects -- have been developed across at least eight fields of application over nine decades. We document this convergence pattern. The physicist's correlation length $\xi$, the cardiologist's DFA scaling exponent $\alpha$, the financial analyst's Hurst exponent $H$, and the machine learning engineer's spectral radius $\chi$ all measure correlation decay rate, detecting the same critical signatures under different notation. Citation analysis reveals minimal cross-domain awareness during the formative period (1987--2010): researchers in biomedicine, finance, machine learning, power systems, and traffic flow developed equivalent techniques independently, each with distinct notation and terminology. We present Metatron Dynamics, a framework derived from distributed systems engineering, as a candidate ninth independent discovery -- strengthening the convergence pattern while acknowledging that as authors of both the framework and this analysis, external validation would strengthen this claim. Correspondence testing on the 2D Ising model confirms that measures from multiple frameworks correctly identify the critical regime at $T_c = 2.269$. We argue that repeated independent discovery establishes criticality mathematics as fundamental public knowledge, with implications for cross-disciplinary education and research accessibility. Because these findings affect fields beyond mathematics and physics, we include a plain-language summary in Appendix B for non-specialist readers.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22389v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Framework for the Bayesian Calibration of Complex and Data-Scarce Models in Applied Sciences</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22890</link><description>arXiv:2601.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we review the theory involved in the Bayesian calibration of complex computer models, with particular emphasis on their use for applications involving computationally expensive simulations and scarce experimental data. In the article, we present a unified framework that incorporates various Bayesian calibration methods, including well-established approaches. Furthermore, we describe their implementation and use with a new, open-source Python library, ACBICI (A Configurable BayesIan Calibration and Inference Package). All algorithms are implemented with an object-oriented structure designed to be both easy to use and readily extensible. In particular, single-output and multiple-output calibration are addressed in a consistent manner. The article completes the theory and its implementation with practical recommendations for calibrating the problems of interest. These guidelines -- currently unavailable in a unified form elsewhere -- together with the open-source Python library, are intended to support the reliable calibration of computational codes and models commonly used in engineering and related fields. Overall, this work aims to serve both as a comprehensive review of the statistical foundations and (computational) tools required to perform such calculations, and as a practical guide to Bayesian calibration with modern software tools.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22890v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning and extrapolating scale-invariant processes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14810</link><description>arXiv:2601.14810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12941</link><description>arXiv:2601.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a widely used full-field measurement technique, but both open-source and commercial packages often have limitations such as operating-system restrictions, lack of support for deployment on computing clusters, and poor scalability to gigapixel-scale images common in Scanning Electron Microscopy DIC (SEM-DIC). Objective: Pyvale is an open-source software package designed for sensor simulation, uncertainty quantification, placement optimization, and calibration/validation. A key component of this is the development of a dedicated 2D DIC module intended for standalone use and integration within broader workflows. Methods: Pyvale provides a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled routines underneath. At its core is a multithreaded, reliability-guided DIC algorithm. Its open-source MIT license enables wide deployment, including on computing clusters and in automated pipelines. Results: Benchmarking with the publicly available 2D DIC challenge 2.0 dataset shows that Pyvale achieves metrological performance comparable to existing commercial and open-source DIC codes. It can correlate gigapixel-scale image pairs in under 5 minutes on high-specification desktop workstations, with memory peaking at approximately 50 GB. Conclusions: Pyvale's strong metrological foundation, coupled with its scalability for SEM-DIC, positions it as a platform for sustained, community-driven development. Its design and licensing provide a foundation for future improvements in open-source DIC and integration into experimental design and validation workflows.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12941v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Publisher Correction: Machine learning predicts meter-scale laboratory earthquakes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67571-1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 02 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67571-1"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67571-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Machine learning predicts meter-scale laboratory earthquakes</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67571-1</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Design of transient plasma photonic structure mirrors for high-power lasers using deep kernel Bayesian optimisation</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02505-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 02 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-026-02505-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-026-02505-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Machine learning is used to design and optimise compact, robust plasma photonic mirrors for ultra-powerful lasers.

Neuromorphic computing offers a brain-inspired approach that unifies computation and memory within a single hardware framework, enabling massively parallel, low-power information processing. Among various device candidates, memtransistors incorporate a gate terminal that enables independent modulation of resistive switching and channel conductance, thereby allowing the realization of complex learning functions and effectively suppressing sneak-path currents in array architectures. This perspective outlines the operation principles of memtransistors based on diverse physical mechanisms, including ion migration, charge trapping, ferroelectric switching, and phase transitions, and then discusses recent materials and architectural engineering strategies, with particular emphasis on two-dimensional channels and scalable array integration. Beyond device-level behavior, bio-inspired functionalities, such as heterosynaptic and homeostatic plasticity, are highlighted as key ingredients for stable and self-regulated learning in neural networks. The integration of memtransistors with sensory modules is further examined to enable near-sensor and in-sensor computing, paving the way for multimodal signal processing that parallels biological perception. Finally, critical challenges and opportunities in variability control, CMOS-compatible processing, and three-dimensional, multisensory integration are identified, indicating that continued progress in material design and architecture optimization will be essential for positioning memtransistors as key enablers of autonomous, bio-inspired intelligence in future robotics, healthcare, and cognitive

Abstract: Amorphous solids exhibit structural short-range order despite lacking long-range crystalline order, with this structural descriptor found to be important for determining mechanical properties. Nanobeam electron diffraction offers a potential route for experimental characterization of structural short-range order, yet efforts to date have been primarily qualitative in nature. In this work, machine learning approaches based on transfer learning are used to enable quantitative analysis of nanobeam electron diffraction data from amorphous solids. A ResNet-18 model is trained on virtual diffraction patterns taken from different locations within simulated metallic glasses and amorphous grain boundary complexions in the Cu-Zr alloy system that were created with hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The disorder parameter is found to be a superior target structural descriptor compared to traditional Voronoi indices for this task. The model achieves a low validation mean absolute error across diffraction patterns corresponding to different interaction volumes, demonstrating excellent performance and potential transferability. Testing was performed using other simulated nanobeam electron diffraction data as well as experimental nanobeam electron diffraction patterns, showing that the model can reliably capture spatial variations in local structural state. As a whole, this framework is able to overcome the challenges in the quantitative experimental characterization of structural short-range order, enabling improved characterization of amorphous solids and the exploration of structure-property relationships.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21091v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamically training machine-learning-based force fields for strongly anharmonic materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21311</link><description>arXiv:2601.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) force fields have emerged as a powerful tool for computing materials properties at finite temperatures, particularly in regimes where traditional phonon-based perturbation theories fail or cannot be extended beyond the harmonic approximation. These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21311v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Screening 39 billion protostructures for materials discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21393</link><description>arXiv:2601.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale computational surveys are increasingly used to map the landscape of stable crystalline materials. We report a high-throughput energy screening of inorganic crystals that enumerates binary and ternary compositions up to a specified unit-cell complexity, yielding 39 billion protostructures. Candidates predicted to lie on or near the convex hull are retained, and their degrees of freedom are explored via Latin hypercube sampling followed by relaxation with machine-learned interatomic potentials. The resulting dataset contains 81 million locally relaxed crystal structures spanning 4495 ternary phase diagrams constructed from elements ranging from lithium to bromine and contains 88,498 crystal prototypes not present in existing crystal-structure databases. The methods are validated both for three well-explored materials systems, Zr-Zn-N, Ti-Zn-N, and Hf-Zn-N, and by comparing with known data for structures resulting from the larger screening. The work provides a systematic map of low-energy compositional-structural space and a large, structured pool of candidates for downstream property evaluation and materials design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21393v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sustainable Materials Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21527</link><description>arXiv:2601.21527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical space through generative models and surrogate screening. Yet current AI workflows optimize performance first, deferring sustainability to post synthesis assessment. This creates inefficiency by the time environmental burdens are quantified, resources have been invested in potentially unsustainable solutions. The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges. Realizing ML-LCA demands coordinated advances in data infrastructure, ex-ante assessment methodologies, multi-objective optimization, and regulatory alignment enabling the discovery of materials that are sustainable by design rather than by chance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21527v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MEIDNet: Multimodal generative AI framework for inverse materials design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22009</link><description>arXiv:2601.22009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22009v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A generative machine learning model for designing metal hydrides applied to hydrogen storage</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20892</link><description>arXiv:2601.20892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20892v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Double-Bracket Master Equations: Phase-Space Representation and Classical Limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20925</link><description>arXiv:2601.20925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical limit of quantum master equations featuring double-bracket dissipators. Specifically, we consider dissipators defined by double commutators, which describe dephasing dynamics, as well as dissipators involving double anticommutators, associated with fluctuating anti-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The classical limit is obtained by formulating the open quantum dynamics in phase space using the Wigner function and Moyal products, followed by a systematic $\hbar$-expansion. We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21056</link><description>arXiv:2601.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.
  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21056v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Thermophysical Properties of Water using Machine-Learned Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21103</link><description>arXiv:2601.21103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21103v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Soft Quantization: Model Compression Via Weight Coupling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21219</link><description>arXiv:2601.21219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21219v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522</link><description>arXiv:2601.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21522v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon from first-principles calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21721</link><description>arXiv:2601.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21721v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Multi-agent Framework for Physical Laws Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16416</link><description>arXiv:2411.16416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering explicit physical laws has traditionally depended on human intuition and domain expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a new route to accelerate this process by automating key steps from hypothesis generation to interpretable model construction. Here we develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework for physical-law discovery that integrates literature-guided variable selection, hypothesis formulation, symbolic regression, formula derivation, and mechanistic explanation. We validate the framework on three representative materials problems: the glass-forming ability (GFA) of metallic glasses, the Vickers hardness of compounds, and the Young's modulus of multi-component alloys. Using physically and chemically meaningful descriptors as inputs, the discovered formulas achieve strong agreement with reference data, with correlation coefficients up to 0.94 (GFA), 0.86 (hardness), and 0.94 (Young's modulus), while remaining compact and interpretable. Beyond fitting, the Young's modulus formula generalizes to quaternary and quinary alloys, improving prediction accuracy by up to 78.8% relative to the classical rule of mixtures. By integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge, reflection mechanisms, and expert-like reasoning ability into symbolic regression, our AI-centric framework offers a robust and extensible platform for automated physical laws discovery, demonstrating that AI can increasingly serve as an essential role in modern scientific research by thinking and acting like field experts.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.16416v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anomalous lattice anharmonicity and spin-lattice coupling in spin orbit coupled halide K2IrBr6</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08204</link><description>arXiv:2503.08204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between lattice distortions, magnetism, and spin-orbit coupling in 5d transition-metal halides offers a fertile platform for exploring correlated spin-lattice dynamics. Here, we investigate the impact of structural symmetry breaking on lattice vibrations and local spin environments in the antifluorite compound K2IrBr6 using temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. K2IrBr6 undergoes successive cubic-to-tetragonal and tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transitions at 170 K and 122 K, respectively, driven by cooperative distortions of the IrBr6 octahedra. Raman spectroscopy reveals anomalous phonon linewidth broadening and unconventional temperature dependence of phonon energies near these transitions, indicating that dynamic spin-phonon coupling is significant well above the Neel temperature (16 K). First-principles phonon calculations support the mode assignments and demonstrate that symmetry-lowering distortions significantly renormalize vibrational modes, consistent with the experimental observations. Complementary EPR measurements detect anisotropic g-factors, resonance field shifts, and linewidth narrowing across the structural transitions, reflecting the emergence of static spin-lattice correlations mediated by spin-orbit entanglement. These findings establish K2IrBr6 as a model system where halide ligand fields, octahedral distortions, and SOC collaboratively govern spin-lattice coupling, providing chemical pathways to engineer quantum materials with tunable magnetic and lattice responses.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.08204v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase Frustration Induced Intrinsic Bose Glass in the Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05781</link><description>arXiv:2601.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an intrinsic "Bubble Phase" in the two-dimensional Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard model, driven purely by phase frustration between complex hopping and anisotropic pairing. By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05781v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v3</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics] Enhanced ion conductivity and stability against Li metal in Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes for high-performance all-solid-state batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847826000183?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 28 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Materiomics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Ying Liang, Chuangjie Guo, Ying Qi, Hetian Chen, Haocheng Yuan, Dengfeng Yu, Peipei Ding, Yue Li, Hong Liu, Yaoyu Ren, Xue Zhang, Ce-Wen Nan&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Materiomics</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 01:58:33 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352847826000183</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Machine Intelligence] On the troubling rise of generative AI suspicion in academic publishing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-026-01178-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Machine Intelligence, Published online: 30 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-026-01178-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42256-026-01178-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;On the troubling rise of generative AI suspicion in academic publishing</description><author>Nature Machine Intelligence</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-026-01178-z</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Statistical physics for artificial neural networks</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011311/3378335/Statistical-physics-for-artificial-neural-networks</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for pioneering contributions at the intersection of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spin-glass physics, underscoring the profound connections between these fields.

Abstract: We present a fermionic gauge theory for deconfined quantum criticality on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice and reveal its shared low-energy field-theoretic structure with the square lattice. Starting from an SU(2) $\pi$-flux parent state, we construct a continuum theory of Dirac spinons coupled to an SU(2) gauge field and adjoint Higgs fields whose condensates drive transitions to a staggered-flux U(1) spin liquid and a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid. While the Shastry-Sutherland lattice permits additional symmetry-allowed fermion bilinears compared to the square lattice, the quantum field theories are identical up to additional irrelevant terms. Consequently, the Higgs potential structure and the leading low-energy theory coincide with the square-lattice case at the quantum critical point. The SO(5) critical point is expected to realize conformal deconfined criticality: we analyze it in a large flavor expansion, calculate its critical exponents, and identify the Yukawa coupling between the fermions and Higgs fields as the relevant perturbation that destabilizes it, consistent with pseudocritical behavior observed in recent Monte Carlo studies. We show that the emergent SO(5) order parameter acquires a large anomalous dimension at the critical point, leading to strongly enhanced N\'eel and VBS susceptibilities-a hallmark of fermionic deconfined quantum criticality consistent with numerical studies. Our results place recent numerical evidence for a gapless $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ Dirac spin liquid on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice within a controlled field-theoretic framework and demonstrate that fermionic deconfined criticality on the square lattice-including critical exponents and stability-extends to frustrated lattices with reduced symmetry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Applied to Materials Property Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20097</link><description>arXiv:2601.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were proposed as an alternative to traditional neural network architectures based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP-NNs). The potential advantages of KANs over MLP-NNs, including significantly enhanced parameter efficiency and increased interpretability, make them a promising new regression model in supervised machine learning problems. We apply KANs to prediction of materials properties, focusing on a diverse set of 33 properties consisting of both experimental and calculated data. We compare the KAN results to random forest, a method that generally gives excellent performance on a wide range of properties predictions with very little optimization. The KANs were worse, on par, or better than random forest about 35%, 60%, and 5% of the time, respectively, and KANs are in practice more difficult to fit than random forest. By tuning the network architecture, we found property fits often resulted in 10-20% lower errors compared to the standard KAN, and typically gave results comparable to random forest. In the specific context of predicting reactor pressure vessel transition temperature shifts, we explored the parameter efficiency and the interpretable power of KANs by comparing predictions of simple KAN models (e.g., &lt; 50 parameters) and closed-form expressions suggested by the KAN fits to previously published deep MLP-NNs and hand-tuned models created using domain expertise of embrittlement physics. We found that simple KAN models and the resulting closed-form expressions produce prediction errors on par with established hand-tuned models with a comparable number of parameters, and required essentially no domain expertise to produce. These findings reinforce the potential applicability of KANs for machine learning in materials science and suggest that KANs should be explored as a regression model for prediction of materials properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revealing Strain Effects on the Graphene-Water Contact Angle Using a Machine Learning Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20134</link><description>arXiv:2601.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how water wets graphene is critical for predicting and controlling its behavior in nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications. A key measure of wetting is the contact angle made by a liquid droplet against the surface, yet experimental measurements for graphene span a wide range, and no consensus has emerged for free-standing graphene. Here, we use a machine learning potential with approaching ab initio accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics and provide an atomistic first-principles benchmark for this unsolved problem. We find the contact angle of water on free-standing graphene, after finite-size correction, to be $72.1 \pm 1.5 \deg$. We also show that the three-phase contact line of a nanoscale water droplet couples strongly to the intrinsic thermal ripples of free-standing graphene, and that graphene's wetting properties are highly sensitive to mechanical strain. Tensile strain makes graphene significantly more hydrophobic, while compressive strain induces coherent ripples that the droplet "surfs", resulting in pronounced anisotropic wetting and contact angle hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that graphene's wetting properties are governed not only by its chemistry but also by its dynamic morphology, offering an additional explanation for the variability of experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanical strain may be a practical route to controlling wetting in graphene-based technologies, with promising consequences for nanofluidic and nano-filtration applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20134v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Morphological Stability of Metal Anodes: Roles of Solid Electrolyte Interphases (SEIs) and Desolvation Kinetics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20751</link><description>arXiv:2601.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable lithium metal anodes requires control over the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and desolvation kinetics. Here, we develop a unified theoretical framework integrating ion transport, desolvation, charge transfer, and SEI breakdown to predict morphological instabilities during electrodeposition. Using linear stability analysis, we identify six dimensionless parameters that govern the onset and evolution of instabilities. We show that SEI transport and desolvation rate effectively modulate apparent reaction kinetics, shifting the system toward a stable, reaction-limited regime. Extending the classical limiting current concept, we demonstrate that a thick, poorly conductive SEI and sluggish desolvation significantly reduce the limiting current. We introduce an apparent Damk\"ohler number to quantify the critical balance: suppressing diffusion-limited instabilities by reaction rate reduction, while maintaining a high limiting current. Our theory enables predictive mapping of electrodeposition morphologies across diverse materials and operating conditions, guiding the rational design of stable lithium metal anodes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20751v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20836</link><description>arXiv:2601.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moir\'e materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moir\'e band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermal Analog Computing: Application to Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22603</link><description>arXiv:2503.22603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising computational demand of modern workloads has renewed interest in energy-efficient paradigms such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A fundamental operation in these systems is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Here, we demonstrate MVM using inverse-designed metastructures that exploit heat conduction as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are obtained via density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation, achieving an accuracy $&gt;99\%$ in most cases across a pool of matrices with dimensions $2\times2$ and $3\times3$. We apply this methodology -- termed thermal analog computing -- to realize matrices relevant to practical tasks, including the discrete Fourier transform and convolutional filters. These findings open new avenues for analog information processing in thermally active environments, including temperature-gradient sensing in microelectronics and thermal control systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.22603v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Materials design based on a material-motif network and heterogeneous graphs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17170</link><description>arXiv:2601.17170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17170v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AiiDA-TrainsPot: Towards automated training of neural-network interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11703</link><description>arXiv:2509.11703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crafting neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) remains a complex task, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce AiiDA-TrainsPot, an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs by orchestrating density-functional-theory calculations, data augmentation strategies, and classical molecular dynamics. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against ab initio reference errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of this calibrated criterion, and show that it minimizes both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to compute from first principles. AiiDA-TrainsPot has a modular design that supports multiple NNIP backends, enabling both the training of NNIPs from scratch and the fine-tuning of foundation models. We demonstrate its capabilities through automated training campaigns targeting pristine and defective carbon allotropes, including amorphous carbon, as well as structural phase transitions in monolayer $\mathrm{W_xMo_{1-x}Te_2}$ alloys.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11703v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link><description>arXiv:2512.23880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or early-stage tool generation, limiting their adaptability and scalability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search, code extraction, and memory utilization; self-reflection via introspection, knowledge graph exploration, and others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23880v2</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Sustainable Cellulose Biopolymers with Tunable Ionic Conductivity and Adhesion for High‐Performance Solid‐State Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.74272?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:24:44 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.74272</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] ArXiv says submissions must be in English: are AI translators up for the job?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00229-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 29 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00229-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00229-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The preprint repository’s requirement could boost the use of large language models to translate scientific texts.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00229-0</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Machine-learning-guided tungsten single atoms promote oxyhydroxides for noble-metal-free water electrolysis</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68735-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 29 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68735-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68735-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sustainable hydrogen production requires efficient oxygen evolution catalysts.

Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accelerated design of proton exchange membranes for green hydrogen production with artificial intelligence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18914</link><description>arXiv:2601.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water electrolysis is an eco-friendly method for hydrogen production that has reached significant levels of technological maturity. Among commercialized water-electrolysis technologies, proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers offer high current density, fast dynamic response, and compact system design, among other advantages. On the other hand, managing their high capital cost and the ``forever-chemistry'' nature of Nafion, a perfluorinated proton-exchange membrane widely used in such devices, remains a major challenge. Searches for fluorine-free replacements for Nafion, pursued largely through physical experimentation, have been active for decades with limited success. In this work, we develop and demonstrate an AI-based strategy for designing new proton-exchange membranes for electrolyzers. Two key components of this strategy are an implementation of the virtual forward-synthesis approach and a set of machine-learning predictive models for essential application-inspired membrane properties; the former generates a vast space of millions of synthesizable polymers, which are then evaluated and screened by the latter. The strategy is validated against experimental data for known membranes and then applied to design over 1,700 new synthesizable candidates. This article concludes with a forward-looking vision in which the strategy could be elevated into an interactive and iterative scheme that are based on large language models to facilitate materials design in multiple ways.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular Hamiltonian learning from setpoint-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19371</link><description>arXiv:2601.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular quantum magnets adsorbed on surfaces exhibit rich spin and orbital excitations that can be probed by scanning tunneling microscopy with inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (STM-IETS). However, the quantitative extraction of the underlying multiorbital Hamiltonian from experimental spectra remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19371v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interband State Transfer in Double-Gated Bilayer Graphene at High Electric Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19869</link><description>arXiv:2601.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene can be tuned using double-gated transistors to apply a perpendicular electric field that generates an interlayer potential energy difference $\Delta$. Dielectric breakdown limits the operation of conventional devices to the $\Delta \ll t_\perp \simeq 360$ meV regime. We employ double ionic gating to reach fields past $ 1$ V/nm, for which $\Delta &gt; t_\perp$. We find that for $\Delta \simeq t_\perp$, the evolution of the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) peak as a function of applied gate voltages undergoes a sharp change in slope, exhibiting a pronounced "knee". Increasing $\Delta$ past the "knee" results in an unusual evolution transport properties: the peak in $R_{xx}$ decreases in magnitude, it exhibits a splitting concomitant with multiple sign reversals of the Hall resistance, and hysteresis in the peak position emerges. We explain the observed phenomenology in terms of in-gap bound states, whose energy strongly depends on the perpendicular electric field, and crosses the mid-gap level for sufficiently large $\Delta &gt; t_\perp$. The phenomenon causes large changes in the electronic density of in-gap states that profoundly affect the evolution of the chemical potential. Our experimental results and their interpretation reveal unique aspects of the physics of in-gap states in Bernal bilayer graphene and demonstrate that double ionic gating enables investigating the large-$\Delta$ regime, which has remained experimentally inaccessible so far.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Technology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18953</link><description>arXiv:2601.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research. Throughout, we highlight experimental implementations that exemplify the increasing role of reinforcement learning in shaping the development of quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18953v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] qNEP: A highly efficient neuroevolution potential with dynamic charges for large-scale atomistic simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19034</link><description>arXiv:2601.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although electrostatics can be incorporated into machine-learned interatomic potentials, existing approaches are computationally very demanding, limiting large-scale, long-time simulations of electrostatics-driven phenomena such as dielectric response, infrared activity, and field-matter coupling. Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface. These results show that qNEP enables accurate atomistic simulations with explicit long-range electrostatics, scalable to million-atom systems on nanosecond time scales using consumer-grade GPUs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19034v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Diagrammer's Note on Superconducting Fluctuation Transport for Beginners: II.

Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.10392v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00090</link><description>arXiv:2506.00090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological systems is the robust quantization of particle transport. It is the origin of the integer-valued quantum Hall conductivity and a potential tool for quantum information technology. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by using arrays of photonic waveguides and described by the (lattice-translational invariant) Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. In these systems, a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound multi-photon states. Upon increasing the interaction strength a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a quantum description of topological pumps of self-bound many-particle states in terms of an effective Hamiltonian of their center-of-mass (COM) motion, which allows to introduce an effective band structure $E_\mu(K)$ with $K$ being the COM momentum, and to classify topological phases in terms of generalized symmetries. We provide an explicit analytic expression of the effective Hamiltonian for few particles in the strong interaction limit and present numerical results in the more general case. We identify a topological invariant, an effective single-particle Chern number, which fully governs the soliton transport. Increasing the interaction strength in the AAH model leads to a successive merging of COM bands, which is the origin of the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential breakdown of topological quantization for some interaction strength.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.00090v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unconventional Josephson effects in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic bilayers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08262</link><description>arXiv:2509.08262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that unconventional Josephson effects can typically emerge in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer systems. When proximitized by a conventional superconductor, these heterostructures host dominant interlayer Cooper pairing that features a distinctive spin texture enabled by the strong exchange field. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for electrically tunable 0-$\pi$ oscillations in lateral Josephson junctions, controlled by an out-of-plane electric displacement field. This behavior originates from field-induced finite-momentum Cooper pairing, a hallmark of the unique layer-pseudospin structure in {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers. Furthermore, we introduce a Josephson giant magnetoresistor based on these exotic spin-layer-locked Cooper pairs, in which the supercurrent exhibits a strong dependence on the internal N\'{e}el order. Our findings establish {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers as a versatile platform for phase-controllable Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic random-access memory, with promising applications in superconducting circuits and ultralow-power computing.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.08262v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21778</link><description>arXiv:2509.21778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-range atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The kinetics of hydrogen diffusion in C15 cubic and C14 hexagonal TiCr$_2$H$_x$ (0 &lt; $x$ &lt;= 4) Laves-phase hydrogen storage alloys is investigated with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values. One-order of magnitude overestimation of diffusion coefficients compared with some experiments suggests a substantial impact of hydrogen trapping by defects such as Cr vacancies and Ti anti-sites in non-stoichiometric TiCr$_2$ in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18069v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Robust qubit interactions mediated by photonic topological edge states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21217</link><description>arXiv:2507.21217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes. We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by topological edge modes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.21217v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] LLM Agents for Knowledge Discovery in Atomic Layer Processing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26201</link><description>arXiv:2509.26201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong path-dependence of results.

Abstract: Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of the synthetic feasibility of hypothetical zeolite-like materials based on ZeoNet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17253</link><description>arXiv:2601.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A suite of classifiers was developed to distinguish real, experimentally realized zeolites from computationally predicted zeolite like structures. Using 3D convolutional neural networks applied to volumetric distance grids, these classifiers achieve accuracies more than an order of magnitude higher than previous approaches based on geometric filters or other machine learning methods. The best-performing model differentiates among hypothetical zeolites and those that can be synthesized as silicates, as aluminophosphates, or as both. This four-class classifier attains a false negative rate of 3.4% and a false positive rate of 0.4%, misidentifying only 1,207 of over 330,000 hypothetical structures -- even though the hypothetical structures exhibit similar formation energies as real zeolites and chemically reasonable bond lengths and angles. We hypothesize that the ZeoNet representation captures essential structural features correlated with synthetic feasibility. In the absence of comprehensive physics-based criteria for synthesizability, the small subset of misclassified hypothetical structures likely represents promising candidates for future experimental synthesis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17253v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Entropic Efficiency of Bayesian Inference Protocols</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17282</link><description>arXiv:2601.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference is a versatile tool that underlies scientific discovery, machine learning, and everyday decision-making: it describes how an agent updates a probability distribution as partial information is acquired from multiple measurements, reducing ignorance about a system's latent state. We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom. This approach provides a quantitative, physically grounded criterion to compare inference strategies, determine their efficiency, and link target information gains to their minimal entropic cost.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17282v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Interface Structure using the Minima Hopping Method with a Machine Learning Interatomic Potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17291</link><description>arXiv:2601.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting atomic-scale interfacial structures remains a central challenge in materials science due to their structural complexity and the difficulty of direct comparison between computational and experimental results. In this study, we present an efficient approach for interface structure prediction that integrates the Minima Hopping Method (MHM) with the state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), Allegro. We demonstrate that the MHM-Allegro approach provides a robust and computationally efficient route for predicting interfacial structures in the benchmark system SrTiO3 Sigma 3 (112)[110] tilt grain boundaries (GBs), consistently identifying the lowest-energy configurations across different stoichiometries. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy for constructing defect-representative training datasets without explicitly including defective configurations, achieving excellent extrapolative performance in interface predictions. The predictive capability is further validated through direct comparison with experimental observations of the SrTiO3 Sigma 5 (310)[001] GB, where the predicted atomic configurations show strong agreement with experimental measurements. This work represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between ab initio predictions and experimentally observed interfacial structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17291v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The dimensionality of the Hopfield model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17427</link><description>arXiv:2601.17427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Binary Intrinsic Dimension (BID), a geometrical measure designed for binary data, to analyze the Hopfield model, a paradigmatic spin system from statistical mechanics, machine learning and neuroscience. The BID allows us to characterize the phases and transitions of this system, and moreover it is robust against finite-size effects that interfere with the correct numerical estimation of the spin-glass order parameter ($q$). We observe that the BID scales linearly with system size in the retrieval and paramagnetic phases, where the correlations between spins are small, and exhibits sublinear scaling in the whole spin-glass phase, highlighting its correlated structure. Furthermore, we establish a direct relationship between the BID and the overlap distribution, unveiling a novel connection between the geometry of the state-space and standard spin order parameters.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17427v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An autonomous living database for perovskite photovoltaics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17807</link><description>arXiv:2601.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is severely bottlenecked by the inability of manual curation to keep pace with exponential publication rates. This creates a widening knowledge gap. This is especially stark in photovoltaics, where the leading database for perovskite solar cells has been stagnant since 2021 despite massive ongoing research output. Here, we resolve this challenge by establishing an autonomous, self-updating living database (PERLA). Our pipeline integrates large language models with physics-aware validation to extract complex device data from the continuous literature stream, achieving human-level precision (&gt;90%) and eliminating annotator variance. By employing this system on the previously inaccessible post-2021 literature, we uncover critical evolutionary trends hidden by data lag: the field has decisively shifted toward inverted architectures employing self-assembled monolayers and formamidinium-rich compositions, driving a clear trajectory of sustained voltage loss reduction. PERLA transforms static publications into dynamic knowledge resources that enable data-driven discovery to operate at the speed of publication.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17807v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An AI-ready fine-tuning framework for accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials in solid-solid battery interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17847</link><description>arXiv:2601.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic modeling of solid-solid battery interfaces is essential for understanding electro-chemo-mechanical coupling, but the complex interfacial chemistry and heterogeneous environments pose major challenges for quantum-accurate, data-efficient modeling. Herein, we propose an approach of fine-tuning with integrated replay and efficiency (FIRE), a general framework for universal machine-learning interatomic potentials by combining efficient configurational sampling with a replay-argumented continual strategy, achieving quantum-level accuracy at moderate cost. Across six solid-solid battery interface systems, FIRE consistently achieves root-mean-square errors in energy below 1 meV/atom and in force near 20 meV/angstrom, marking an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing models while requiring only 10% of the original datasets. In addition, the fine-tuned model successfully reproduces key mechanical and electrochemical properties of the materials, in close agreement with experimental data. The FIRE offers a generalizable and data-efficient approach for developing accurate interatomic potentials across diverse materials, enabling predictive simulations beyond the reach of first-principles methods.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17847v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hybridization of topologically distinct quartet modes in three-terminal graphene Josephson junctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18036</link><description>arXiv:2601.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions offer a powerful playground for exploring exotic superconducting and topological phenomena beyond the reach of conventional two-terminal devices. In this work, we present the direct spectroscopic observation of Cooper quartet resonances, a signature of correlated tunneling of two Cooper pairs across the device, in a graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ). Using tunneling spectroscopy, we visualize how Andreev bound states (ABS) evolve across a two-dimensional superconducting phase space, controlled by the two independent phase differences in the 3TJJ. These measurements reveal sharp local minima in the differential conductance spectra locked in a specific phase condition of superconducting phase variables. The resulting quantized trajectories around the compact torus of the superconducting phase variables reveal an underlying topological winding in the multipair transport. To interpret our results, we develop a theoretical model that connects the observed quartet resonances to the coherent hybridization of multiple ABS branches, a hallmark of the rich pairing process enabled by multiterminal geometries. Our results highlight the potential of multiterminal superconducting devices to host engineered superconducting states and pave the way for new approaches to topological band structure design based on phase-controlled, higher-order superconducting transport.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18036v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multimodal Machine Learning for Soft High-k Elastomers under Data Scarcity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18032</link><description>arXiv:2601.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric materials are critical building blocks for modern electronics such as sensors, actuators, and transistors. With the rapid recent advance in soft and stretchable electronics for emerging human- and robot-interfacing applications, there is a surging need for high-performance dielectric elastomers. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop soft elastomers that simultaneously possess high dielectric constants (k, related to energy storage capacity) and low Young's moduli (E, related to mechanical flexibility). While some new elastomer designs have been reported in individual (mostly one-off) studies, almost no structured dataset is currently available for dielectric elastomers that systematically encompasses their molecular sequence, dielectric, and mechanical properties. Within this context, we curate a compact, high-quality dataset of acrylate-based dielectric elastomers, one of the most widely explored elastomer backbones due to its versatile chemistry and molecular design flexibility, by screening and aggregating experimental results from the literature over the past 10 years. Building on this dataset, we propose a multimodal learning framework that leverages large-scale pretrained polymer representations from graph- and sequence-based encoders. These pretrained embeddings transfer rich chemical and structural knowledge from vast polymer corpora, enabling accurate few-shot prediction of both dielectric and mechanical properties from molecular sequences. Our results represent a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pretrained multimodal models to overcome severe data scarcity, which can be readily translated to other polymer backbones (e.g., silicones, urethanes) and thus accelerate data-efficient discovery of soft high-k dielectric elastomers.

Abstract: The global optimization of atomic clusters represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and materials science due to the exponential growth of local minima with system size (i.e., the curse of dimensionality). We introduce a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the low-rank structure of potential energy surfaces through Tensor Train (TT) decomposition. Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations. This work establishes TT-decomposition as a powerful tool for molecular structure prediction and provides a general framework adaptable to a wide range of high-dimensional optimization problems in computational material science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18592v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SmoQyDQMC.jl: A flexible implementation of determinant quantum Monte Carlo for Hubbard and electron-phonon interactions (version 2.0 release)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395</link><description>arXiv:2311.09395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians with local and extended Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, including non-linear e-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice potentials. Our implementation uses an optimized hybrid Monte Carlo method with exact forces to efficiently sample the phonon fields, enabling the simulation of low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager.

Abstract: Achieving parametric excitation in an oscillating physical system involves periodically adjusting one of its parameters to modulate the oscillator's natural frequency. This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems within physics and engineering, profoundly transforming modern science and technology. Despite rapid progress, the parametric control of collective excitations, such as phonons, remains a challenge while promising to generate novel and intriguing effects in a largely unexplored field. Here, we investigate the terahertz (THz) field-induced dynamics of Raman-active phonons in the perovskite structure of LaAlO$_3$ (LAO). Utilizing intense THz pulses, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of parametric phonon excitation marked by substantial subharmonic components. Theoretical analysis can successfully capture the hallmarks of the observed phenomena in a physical scenario with the THz field inducing a parametric coupling between the Raman mode and pairs of acoustic phonon excitations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.06748v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] InSpecLearn4SDL: Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21330</link><description>arXiv:2509.21330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accelerate materials discovery using self-driving labs (SDLs), we present a machine learning pipeline that predicts the electrical conductivity of doped conjugated polymers using rapid, non-destructive optical spectroscopy. Our approach automates spectral featurization by combining a genetic algorithm with adaptive area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations, creating a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) that links optical response and processing parameters to conductivity. By incorporating SHAP-guided selection and domain-knowledge-based feature expansion, the model matches expert-curated performance while theoretically reducing experimental effort by $\sim 33\%$ by minimizing the need for costly direct conductivity measurements. Notably, the model recovers known physical descriptors in pBTTT and identifies informative tail-state regions correlated with polymer bleaching upon successful doping. This generic, interpretable, small-data-friendly methodology can be extended to other spectroscopic modalities, such as Raman or FTIR, providing a framework for autonomous decision-making in SDLs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21330v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] LLM tools in the prediction of the stability of perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11615</link><description>arXiv:2512.11615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting degradation rates is an important task in the development of new perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, we explore the feasibility of solving this problem using Machine Learning models supported by LLM tools. We consider both the "lifetime" prediction of the device and the prediction of degree of its degradation at specific time intervals. We demonstrate the ability of common LLM tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek) to suggest and justify prediction methods in a dialogue with the user under conditions of incomplete information about the physical models of PSC degradation and the influence of the environment, providing rather accurate prediction. The results cover the formation of time series of efficiency with a given architecture, calculated using various available mathematical models together with environmental characteristics archived in various meteorological databases (illumination, temperature, humidity, UV level). We conclude that ChatGPT currently has sufficient access to training samples, can suggest to PSC designer various PSC models in the literature, and has adequate solutions for predicting degradation trends.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11615v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14258</link><description>arXiv:2404.14258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2404.14258v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link><description>arXiv:2405.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) show evidence that they are protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.10360v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19151</link><description>arXiv:2508.19151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense Associative Memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to cutting edge machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanism and generative diffusion. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.19151v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231</link><description>arXiv:2512.21231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21231v3</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

This study theoretically investigates the dynamic modulation of QAHE in two-dimensional noncollinear antiferromagnetic (NAFM) kagome organic–metal framework Sc&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; under both resonant and non-resonant schemes via Floquet engineering. First-principles calculations demonstrate that in monolayer Sc&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the NAFM state exhibits superior magnetic stability compared to the collinear ferromagnetic state, while possessing a symmetry-protected Dirac point below the Fermi level, and this characteristic differentiates it from the lower-energy but topologically trivial antiferromagnetic state. Circularly polarized light (CPL) dynamically breaks mirror symmetry (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;), thereby opening a topologically non-trivial bandgap and generating quantized anomalous Hall conductance. By rotating the magnetic moments, we obtained three typical configurations: Type-I (e.g.,  ϕ=0°) exhibits stable QAHE; Type-II (e.g.,  ϕ=60°) is topologically trivial; Type-III (e.g.,  ϕ=150°) enables optically tunable edge states. Further investigation under low-energy CPL ( ℏω=0.2  eV) reveals chiral-inverted edge channels and higher optical modulation sensitivity, with the required light intensity for quantization reduced by 25% compared to the high-energy regime. Notably, the propagation direction of the surface states is strictly locked to the light helicity; switching the chirality of circular polarization enables reversal of both the edge state direction and the sign of the Chern number.

Abstract: Hafnia (HfO2) is a silicon-compatible dielectric material, yet stabilizing its desired but metastable ferroelectric phase remains challenging. Phase stability predictions by density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial guidance, but most simulations neglected or only treated finite temperature effects with (quasi-)harmonic approximation due to high computational cost of DFT. Here, we develop a machine learning force field and perform thermodynamic calculations for HfO2 using self-consistent phonon theory to address growing evidence of anharmonicity. Our results reveal that the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase oIII exhibits metastability below 0.1kBT under most conditions within the simulated regime of temperature and pressure (600 K &lt;= T &lt;= 1500 K and 0 &lt;= p &lt;= 7.5 GPa), contradicting previous harmonic predictions of metastability above 1500 K at ambient pressure. We further report evidence for temperature- and pressure-dependent ferroelectric parent phase despite efforts to identify a universal one. This study highlights the importance of anharmonicity and provides an effective approach for its treatment in the design of HfO2-based ferroelectrics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16420v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Simulations of High Temperature Decomposition of Metal-Organic Frameworks to form Amorphous Catalysts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16459</link><description>arXiv:2601.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials formed through high temperature processes show great potential as catalysts. However, understanding of structure-property relationships between the initial MOF and the resulting MOF-derived catalyst is limited because the amorphous nature of the catalyst challenges standard structural characterization methods. Neural network approaches that learn interatomic potentials from density functional theory offer a promising solution. We simulated the pyrolysis of UiO-66, UiO-67 and MIP-206 using both foundational and fine-tuned machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). To mimic experimental conditions, an atmosphere of CO2 and H2 was introduced and the structures were doped with 20 wt% copper to probe the effect of copper on the structural evolution of MOFs. These simulations provide atomistic insights into gas evolution, metal nanoparticle formation, and linker decomposition that were compared to available experimental data. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of MLIPs to accurately model high temperature MOF dynamics under experimentally relevant conditions and guide the design of new catalytic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16459v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Synergistic effects of ferromagnetic elements and LAGP solid electrolyte in suppressing and trapping polysulfide shuttle transfers in lithium-sulfur batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16544</link><description>arXiv:2601.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large - scale commercialization of promising lithium - sulfur (Li - S) batteries remains limited by the polysulfide shuttle effect, which causes rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this study, we present a scalable strategy to mitigate this challenge by modifying polyethylene (PE) separators with ferromagnetic and solid - state ionic coatings. Thin films of nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), and the Li - ion - conducting ceramic Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) were deposited via ion beam sputtering, while Ni ion implantation was also employed to modify the PE substrate. The electrochemical performance of pristine and modified separators was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and staircase voltammetry (SV) in liquid electrolyte within H - cell configurations. Surface morphology and elemental composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The results show that LAGP-based coatings significantly enhance separator stability and effectively suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to lower redox peak intensities and improved cycling performance. In contrast, Ni coatings exhibited poor long - term stability, likely due to parasitic reactions or delamination during its life time. The combined LAGP/Co architecture provided the most effective suppression of the polysulfide shuttle, attributed to synergistic ionic and catalytic effects that promote interfacial stability and selective ion transport. Ni implantation into PE showed only a negligible effect. This study highlights the potential of integrating solid ionic conductors with ferromagnetic layers to design multifunctional separators for high-performance Li - S batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16544v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AI-enhanced discovery and accelerated synthesis of metal phosphosulfides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16693</link><description>arXiv:2601.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal phosphosulfides have emerged as unique multifunctional materials, but they present unique synthesis challenges compared to more established material classes such as oxides and nitrides. As a consequence, experimental development and theoretical understanding of phosphosulfides have focused on individual compounds rather than on accelerated broad-range exploration. In this work, we first evaluate the synthesizability and band gaps of 909 hypothetical ternary phosphosulfides by density functional theory. We find 19 previously unknown thermodynamically stable compounds, including the first Si- and Ge-based phosphosulfides. For rapid band gap prediction, we then develop a multi-fidelity machine learning model to translate semilocal density functional theory band gaps into experimentally calibrated band gaps. Importantly, we extend the accelerated material development workflow to the experimental domain by demonstrating a route to high-throughput synthesis and characterization of virtually any phosphosulfide material system. The method is based on thin-film combinatorial libraries and yields over 100 unique compositions in each experiment, enabling us to synthesize four distinct phosphosulfide compounds in only four combinatorial experiments without prior synthesis recipes and without compromising on material quality. Thus, we argue that accelerated materials development workflows combining theory, artificial intelligence, synthesis, and characterization can be viable even for experimentally challenging inorganic materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16693v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charting the Landscape of Oxygen Ion Conductors: A 60-Year Dataset with Interpretable Regression Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16852</link><description>arXiv:2601.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen ion conductors are indispensable materials for such as solid oxide fuel cells, sensors, and membranes. Despite extensive research across diverse structural families, systematic data enabling comparative analysis remain scarce. Here, we present a curated dataset of oxygen ion conductors compiled from $84$ experimental reports spanning $60$ years, covering $483$ materials. Each record includes activation energy ($E_a$) and prefactor ($A$) derived from Arrhenius plots, alongside detailed metadata on structure, composition, measurement method, and data source. When the original papers derive these using an erroneous Arrhenius equation $\sigma_T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$, where ($\sigma_T$ is the oxygen ion conductivity at temperature $T$ and $R$ is the gas constant), we replotted these using the correct one, $\sigma_{T}T=A\exp{\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)}$. To illustrate how the database can be used, we constructed interpretable regression models for predicting oxygen ionic conductivity. Two symbolic regression models for E_a and A suggest that oxygen ion transport is primarily governed by local coordination environment and the electrostatic interactions, respectively. This dataset establishes a reliable foundation for data-driven discovery and predictive modeling of next-generation oxygen ion conductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16852v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Active learning for photonics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16287</link><description>arXiv:2601.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning for photonic crystals explores the integration of analytic approximate Bayesian last layer neural networks (LL-BNNs) with uncertainty-driven sample selection to accelerate photonic band gap prediction. We employ an analytic LL-BNN formulation, corresponding to the infinite Monte Carlo sample limit, to obtain uncertainty estimates that are strongly correlated with the true predictive error on unlabeled candidate structures. These uncertainty scores drive an active learning strategy that prioritizes the most informative simulations during training. Applied to the task of predicting band gap sizes in two-dimensional, two-tone photonic crystals, our approach achieves up to a 2.6x reduction in required training data compared to a random sampling baseline while maintaining predictive accuracy. The efficiency gains arise from concentrating computational resources on high uncertainty regions of the design space rather than sampling uniformly. Given the substantial cost of full band structure simulations, especially in three dimensions, this data efficiency enables rapid and scalable surrogate modeling. Our results suggest that analytic LL-BNN based active learning can substantially accelerate topological optimization and inverse design workflows for photonic crystals, and more broadly, offers a general framework for data efficient regression across scientific machine learning domains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979</link><description>arXiv:2601.16979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($\lambda_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $\Delta \mathbf{\theta}$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($\lambda_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16979v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defects and Impurity Properties of VN precipitates in ARAFM Steels: Modelling using a Universal Machine Learning Potential and Experimental Validation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19720</link><description>arXiv:2503.19720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VN precipitates used to strengthen ARAFM steels for fusion applications dissolve under high Fe ion irradiation (100 dpa at 10^-3 dpa s^-1, 600 C). This study examined point defects and solute substitutions using atom probe tomography, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. Combined with transmission electron microscopy, results show N-vacancies and substitutional Cr exist in VN precipitates before irradiation. Monte Carlo simulations and collision cascade simulations confirm ordered vacancies at operating temperatures help mitigate irradiation damage. However, solute additions disrupt vacancy ordering and enhance irradiation-induced damage, potentially accelerating dissolution.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.19720v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link><description>arXiv:2601.02150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02150v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Technology is changing how we write — and how we think about writing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00245-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 26 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00245-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00245-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An exploration of how writing systems, from ancient Chinese characters to modern alphabets, shape language, and whether users of ChatGPT can be said to be authors at all.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00245-0</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Self-optimizing machine learning potential assisted automated workflow for highly efficient complex systems material design</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01971-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 26 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01971-9"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01971-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Self-optimizing machine learning potential assisted automated workflow for highly efficient complex systems material design</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01971-9</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Towards an understanding of photoluminescence in lead-free Cs2AgxNa1-xBiyIn1-yCl6 double perovskites by machine learning prediction from density-functional theory ground state properties</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00152H</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00152H, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Marina Selana Günthert, Larry Lüer, Oleksandr Stroyuk, Oleksandra Raievska, Christian Kupfer, Andres Osvet, Bernd Meyer, Christoph J Brabec&lt;br /&gt;Halide double perovskites are an emerging class of lead-free materials for optoelectronic and photo-voltaic applications.

Abstract: We propose a framework for generating magnetic structures, inspired by the concept of oriented spin space groups (SSGs): magnetic structures are first generated as totally symmetric representations of an SSG and are then rotated such that they belong to the maximal magnetic space group of the SSG, which we term spin-symmetry-adapted (SSA) structures and oriented SSA structures, respectively. This is a natural framework to enforce fixed magnetic moment magnitudes on the symmetry-equivalent sites as well as to exploit the spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced hierarchy of energy scales. To examine the present scheme, we analyze the MAGNDATA database and find that 77% of the reported structures are reproducible at the SSG level, among which 82% are fully reproduced within the oriented SSG scheme, regardless of their spin-only group types or propagation vectors. To quantitatively assess computational and predictive performance, we perform spin density functional theory calculations for 283 materials, first carrying out self-consistent calculations for SSA structures without SOC, followed by fixed-charge calculations including SOC for the descendant oriented SSA structures. The experimental magnetic structures are reproduced as energetically most stable in 82% of cases at the SSG level without SOC and in 76% of cases at the oriented SSG level with SOC, showing that the fixed-charge scheme enables accurate evaluation of SOC-induced energy differences at low computational cost. The characteristic energy scale among oriented SSA structures is only $\sim$0.29 meV per magnetic atom, about 300 times smaller than that of distinct SSA structures. These results demonstrate that oriented SSG-based enumeration, combined with the two-step calculations for SSA and oriented SSA structures, provides an efficient and robust route for large-scale magnetic-structure prediction.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Materealize: a multi-agent deliberation system for end-to-end material design and synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15743</link><description>arXiv:2601.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Materealize, a multi-agent system for end-to-end inorganic materials design and synthesis that orchestrates core domain tools spanning structure generation, property prediction, synthesizability prediction, and synthesis planning within a single unified framework. Through a natural-language interface, Materealize enables non-experts to access computational materials workflows and obtain experimentally actionable outputs for material realization. Materealize provides two complementary modes. In instant mode, the system rapidly composes connected tools to solve diverse inorganic tasks-including property-conditioned synthesizable candidate design with synthesis recipes, diagnosis, and redesign of unsynthesizable structures, and synthesizable data augmentation-within a few minutes. In thinking mode, Materealize applies multi-agent debate to deliver more refined and information-rich synthesis recommendations, including reasoning- and model-driven synthesis routes and mechanistic hypotheses. The mechanistic hypotheses are validated by direct comparison with the literature for known mechanisms and further supported by physics-grounded simulations for novel synthesis pathways. By combining tool-level accuracy with reasoning-level integration, Materealize can bridge the gap between computational discovery and practical experimental realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15743v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] NASICON solid-electrolyte modification and analysis using ion and neutron beams</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15845</link><description>arXiv:2601.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid electrolytes (SEs) for sodium-based superionic conductors (NaSICON) are widely recognized for their excellent ionic conductivity and application in sodium based energy storage systems. While considerable effort has been made to develop thin electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) for lithium ions, only a few sodium-based SEs have been successfully fabricated as thin films. These thin films are particularly desirable for their reduced electrical resistance, which typically increases with the thickness of the SE. By reducing the thickness of the SEs to the nanometer scale, their ionic conductivity can be significantly enhanced. In this study, the NASICON composite was initially prepared in the form of pellets using the mixed oxide technique with a planetary ball mill and synthesized by the solid-state method at 1250 {\deg}C. The resulting pellets were used as sputtering targets in a low-energy ion facility to prepare continuous and uniform NASICON nanofilms. To explore the effect of ion implantation on the electrical properties of NASICON, the prepared films were bombarded with Ni ions at 1.1 MeV and varying fluences, using the Tandetron accelerator at the CANAM infrastructure (NPI \v{R}e\v{z}). The electrical properties of both the synthesized and implanted films were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results, describing the impact of irradiation on NASICON's properties, are presented here.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Coarsening dynamics of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns: Machine learning assisted characterization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16006</link><description>arXiv:2601.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fingerprint labyrinthine patterns exhibit a level of structural complexity beyond simple stripe phases, combining local stripe order with a dense network of point-like defects. Unlike symmetry-breaking phases, where coarsening proceeds via diffusive defect annihilation, or conventional stripe phases, where curvature-driven motion of extended grain boundaries dominates, the coarsening of fingerprint labyrinths is governed primarily by localized junction and terminal defects. Using the Turing-Swift-Hohenberg equation, we study the nonequilibrium relaxation of fingerprint labyrinthine patterns following a quench. To go beyond conventional Fourier-based diagnostics, we employ a template-matching convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) to identify and track junctions and terminals directly in real space, enabling a quantitative characterization of defect statistics and spatial correlations. We show that, although these point-like defects drive coarsening, their motion is strongly constrained by the surrounding stripe geometry, leading to slow, nondiffusive dynamics that are qualitatively distinct from both conventional phase ordering and stripe coarsening. Together, these results establish defect-mediated dynamics as the central organizing principle of fingerprint labyrinthine coarsening and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning-assisted approaches for complex pattern-forming systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16006v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26022</link><description>arXiv:2509.26022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26022v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704</link><description>arXiv:2510.04704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04704v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05227</link><description>arXiv:2510.05227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states.

We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05227v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bound States from Berry Curvature and Chiral Superconductivity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08055</link><description>arXiv:2601.08055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi-sea area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring nearly periodically in $\Phi$ with period two. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little-Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08055v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05717</link><description>arXiv:2512.05717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that uMLIPs encode the chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05717v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Spatial heterogeneity and subtypes of functional connectivity development in youth</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68707-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 23 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68707-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68707-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This study applies machine learning to fMRI data to map developmental variations in functional connectivity, uncovering heterogeneity across individuals and cortical regions that predicts neurocognitive maturation in youth.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68707-7</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Text mining-assisted machine learning prediction and experimental validation of emission wavelengths</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01967-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 23 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01967-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41524-026-01967-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Text mining-assisted machine learning prediction and experimental validation of emission wavelengths</description><author>npj Computational Materials</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-026-01967-5</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Daily briefing: Why cancer might protect against Alzheimer’s disease</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00257-w</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 23 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00257-w"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00257-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A protein made by cancer cells seems to break down the hallmark plaques of Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has deeply changed some fields recently, like Language and Vision and we may expect it to be relevant also to the analysis of of complex systems. Here we want to tackle the question of how and to which extent can one regress scale-free processes, i.e. processes displaying power law behavior, like earthquakes or avalanches? We are interested in predicting the large ones, i.e. rare events in the training set which therefore require extrapolation capabilities of the model. For this we consider two paradigmatic problems that are statistically self-similar. The first one is a 2-dimensional fractional Gaussian field obeying linear dynamics, self-similar by construction and amenable to exact analysis. The second one is the Abelian sandpile model, exhibiting self-organized criticality. The emerging paradigm of Geometric Deep Learning shows that including known symmetries into the model's architecture is key to success. Here one may hope to extrapolate only by leveraging scale invariance. This is however a peculiar symmetry, as it involves possibly non-trivial coarse-graining operations and anomalous scaling. We perform experiments on various existing architectures like U-net, Riesz network (scale invariant by construction), or our own proposals: a wavelet-decomposition based Graph Neural Network (with discrete scale symmetry), a Fourier embedding layer and a Fourier-Mellin Neural Operator. Based on these experiments and a complete characterization of the linear case, we identify the main issues relative to spectral biases and coarse-grained representations, and discuss how to alleviate them with the relevant inductive biases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14810v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Ionic transport in spontaneously ion-intercalated van der Waals layered structures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14836</link><description>arXiv:2601.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport under strong confinement is crucial for the design of next-generation energy, catalytic, and information-processing materials; however, repeated field-driven ion motion often degrades conventional solid electrolytes. Van der Waals layered materials offer an alternative by providing structurally resilient ion-transport channels, yet the microscopic origins of their nonequilibrium transport behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate field-driven ionic conduction in sodium-intercalated layered MnO$_2$ as a model self-intercalated van der Waals solid, using all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that explicitly capture ion-water correlations and layer morphology. We demonstrate that ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, interlayer spacing, water content, and lattice flexibility. The applied electric field induces spatial segregation of water coupled to distortions of the MnO$_2$ sheets, producing coexisting regions populated by highly hydrated and weakly hydrated ions with suppressed conductivity. Concurrently, ionic transport exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the total amount of intercalated water, with boundary domains of weakly hydrated ions displaying relatively higher mobility. In fluctuation-free layers, ion transport transitions from single-particle motion to a collective conduction regime characterized by elongated, same-charge ionic clusters that violate Nernst-Einstein behavior. Together, these findings provide a molecular-level mechanism linking confinement-induced electrostatic correlations and structural response to the emergent nonlinear transport observed experimentally in ion-intercalated MnO$_2$, and suggest general design principles for robust, water-assisted ionic conductors.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning minimal representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11608</link><description>arXiv:2307.11608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2307.11608v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Defect-modified acoustic phonons in a single layer of MoS2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14464</link><description>arXiv:2503.14464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal, mechanical, and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is governed by their low-energy phonons, yet the impact of atomic-scale disorder on these modes remains poorly understood. Here, we report the first measurement of acoustic phonon dispersions in a quasi-freestanding monolayer semiconductor (MoS2), using helium-3 spin-echo spectroscopy. We identify a defect-driven regime change at a critical wavevector, $q_c$, marking the breakdown of continuum elastic behavior. At this length scale, the flexural mode transitions from continuum bending to defect-pinned standing waves, while the hybridized Rayleigh wave becomes vibrationally disordered in its dispersion and linewidth. We observe multiple defect-induced Van Hove singularities deep within the Brillouin zone and strongly suppressed acoustic group velocities, providing direct experimental evidence that four-phonon processes drive thermal transport in mono- and few-layer MoS2. These results offer a microscopic explanation for the anomalously low thermal conductivity widely observed in transition-metal dichalcogenides and demonstrate how atomic-scale disorder dictates energy flow in two-dimensional materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.14464v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Physics-Based Factorized Machine Learning for Predicting Ionic Dielectric Tensors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26022</link><description>arXiv:2509.26022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26022v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121</link><description>arXiv:2601.13121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13121v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] When two years of academic work vanished with a single click</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04064-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 22 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04064-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-025-04064-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;After turning off ChatGPT’s ‘data consent’ option, Marcel Bucher lost the work behind grant applications, teaching materials and publication drafts.

Abstract: Autonomous materials science, where active learning is used to navigate large compositional phase space, has emerged as a powerful vehicle to rapidly explore new materials. A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11775v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovery of Van Hove Singularities: Electronic Fingerprints of 3Q Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Quantum Magnet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11796</link><description>arXiv:2601.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging as a rich platform for exploring exotic quantum states in van der Waals magnets. Among them, CoxTaS2 has attracted intense interest following the recent discovery of a distinctive 3Q magnetic ground state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect below a critical doping of x=1/3, both intimately tied to cobalt concentration. To date, direct signatures of this enigmatic 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure remain elusive. Here we report a comprehensive doping dependent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy study that unveils these long-sought fingerprints. Our data reveal an unexpected "inverse Mexican hat" dispersion along the K-M-K direction, accompanied by two van Hove singularities. These features are consistent with theoretical predictions for a 3Q magnetic order near three-quarters band filling on a cobalt triangular lattice. These results provide evidence of 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure, establishing TMD van der Waals magnets as tunable materials to explore the interplay between magnetism and topology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11796v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Significant impact of Al1-xGaxN interlayer on GaN/AlN thermal boundary conductance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12151</link><description>arXiv:2601.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlN-GaN heterostructures are central to high-power and high-frequency electronics, including RF devices, power converters, and AI accelerators. An intermediate Al1-xGaxN (AlGaN) layer is often present, either unintentionally during growth or intentionally to induce a 2D electron gas, yet its impact on the interfacial thermal boundary conductance (TBC) remains unknown due to the lack of reliable measurement or modeling methods. Here, we report a first principles-based evaluation of the TBCs of AlN-AlGaN, AlGaN-GaN, and AlN-AlGaN-GaN interfaces over the full alloy range. This is realized by the development of accurate deep learning interatomic potentials based on first-principles simulations. Contrary to other material systems where mixed interlayers enhance thermal coupling, we find that an AlGaN interlayer markedly degrades TBC between GaN and AlN, explaining the observation in experiments. Finally, we show that if the Al composition is sigmoidally transitioned from 0 to 1 across the AlN-GaN interface, it can remarkably increase the TBC, compared to an abrupt or a linear transition. This work is expected to shed light on an accurate thermal analysis and electro-thermal co-design of future AlGaN-based devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12170</link><description>arXiv:2601.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moir\'e bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moir\'e valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moir\'e orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12170v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Artificial Intelligence in Materials Science and Engineering: Current Landscape, Key Challenges, and Future Trajectorie</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12554</link><description>arXiv:2601.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming materials science and engineering, offering powerful tools to navigate complexity, accelerate discovery, and optimize material design in ways previously unattainable. Driven by the accelerating pace of algorithmic advancements and increasing data availability, AI is becoming an essential competency for materials researchers. This review provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the current landscape, synthesizing recent advancements and methodologies for materials scientists seeking to effectively leverage these data-driven techniques. We survey the spectrum of machine learning approaches, from traditional algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, including CNNs, GNNs, and Transformers, alongside emerging generative AI and probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification. The review also examines the pivotal role of data in this field, emphasizing how effective representation and featurization strategies, spanning compositional, structural, image-based, and language-inspired approaches, combined with appropriate preprocessing, fundamentally underpin the performance of machine learning models in materials research. Persistent challenges related to data quality, quantity, and standardization, which critically impact model development and application in materials science and engineering, are also addressed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12554v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] INTERFACE Force Field for Alumina with Validated Bulk Phases and a pH-Resolved Surface Model Database for Electrolyte and Organic Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12570</link><description>arXiv:2601.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alumina and aluminum oxyhydroxides underpin chemical-engineering technologies from heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion protection, functional coatings, energy-storage devices, to biomedical components. Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces.

Abstract: Reproducibility of computational results remains a challenge in materials science, as simulation workflows and parameters are often reported only in unstructured text and tables. While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12582v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Correlation between superfluid density and transition temperature in infinite-layer nickelate superconductor $Nd_{1-x}Sr_xNiO_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12676</link><description>arXiv:2601.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong correlation between zero-temperature superfluid density ($\rho_{s0}$) and transition temperature ($T_c$) is considered as a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity. However, their relationship has yet to be unveiled in nickelates due to sample inhomogeneity. Here we perform local susceptometry on an infinite-layer nickelate superconductor $Nd_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}NiO_2$. The sample shows inhomogeneous superfluid density and $T_c$ on micron-scale. The spatial statistics for different scan areas reveal a linear dependence of local $T_c$ on $\rho_{s0}$ for $T_c$&gt;8 K and a sub-linear one for $T_c$&lt;8 K. Remarkably, the overall relationship is reminiscent of that reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors, hinting at a close connection between them.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12676v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall formation in tetragonal phase BaTiO3 via machine learning potential</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12914</link><description>arXiv:2601.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 exhibit spontaneous polarization that can be reoriented by an external electric field, forming the basis of various memory, actuator, and sensor applications. The polarization switching behavior, however, is strongly influenced by mechanical boundary conditions due to the intrinsic electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics. In this study, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential to investigate the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall evolution in the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3. This study revealed a critical stress about 120 MPa which 90 degree polarization switching occurs. Beyond the critical stress, larger supercells exhibit lower activation energies for polarization switching with 180-degree domain wall formation and weaker constraints from periodic boundary conditions, thereby facilitating domain-wall formation. Besides, Increasing compressive stress reduces both the remnant polarization and the coercive field, while a double hysteresis loop emerges at a stress level of 80 MPa. These findings provide atomistic insights into stress-controlled ferroelectric switching and highlight the crucial role of mechanical loading in designing reliable ferroelectric devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12914v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Multiscale Prediction of Polymer Relaxation Dynamics via Computational and Data-Driven Methods</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12942</link><description>arXiv:2601.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiscale modeling approach that integrates molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to investigate the glass transition dynamics of polymer systems. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of four representative polymers are estimated using simulations and machine learning model trained on experimental datasets. These predicted Tg values are used as inputs to the ECNLE theory to compute the temperature dependence of structural relaxation times and diffusion coefficients, and the dynamic fragility. The Tg values predicted from simulations show good quantitative agreement with experimental data. While machine learning tends to slightly overestimate Tg, the resulting dynamic fragility values remain close to experimental fragilities. Overall, ECNLE calculations using these inputs agree well with broadband dielectric spectroscopy results. Our integrated approach provides a practical and scalable tool for predicting the dynamic behavior of polymers, particularly in systems where experimental data are limited.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12942v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning interatomic potentials for solid-state precipitation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12984</link><description>arXiv:2601.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are routinely used to model diverse atomistic phenomena, yet parameterizing them to accurately capture solid-state phase transformations remains difficult. We present error metrics and data-generation schemes designed to streamline the parameterization of MLIPs for modeling precipitation in multi-component alloys. We developed an algorithm that enumerates symmetrically distinct transformation pathways connecting chemical decorations on different parent crystal structures. Additionally, we introduce the weighted Kendall-$\tau$ coefficient and its semi-grand canonical generalization as metrics for quantifying MLIP accuracy in predicting low-temperature thermodynamics. We apply these approaches to parameterize an MLIP for a dilute Mg-Nd alloy. The resulting potential reproduces the complex early-stage precipitation behavior observed in experiment. Large-scale atomistic simulations reveal competition between order-disorder and structural transformations. Furthermore, these results suggest a continuous transition between high-symmetry hcp and bcc crystal structures during aging heat treatments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12984v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13121</link><description>arXiv:2601.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13121v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13125</link><description>arXiv:2601.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13125v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Guided Polymorph Selection in Molecular Beam Epitaxy of In2Se3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13156</link><description>arXiv:2601.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide (In2Se3), a layered chalcogenide with multiple polymorphs, is a promising material for optoelectronic and ferroelectric applications. However, achieving polymorph-pure thin films remains a major challenge due to the complex growth space. In this work, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is successfully leveraged to guide the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of In2Se3 on Al2O3 substrates. By training a predictive Gaussian Process Regressor with sequential learning, we efficiently explored substrate temperature, indium flux, selenium flux, and cracker temperature, reducing experimental trials required for successful synthesis. A {\gamma}-In2Se3 film with 91% phase purity was achieved after fewer than ten trials. Attempts to isolate {\alpha}-In2Se3 were limited by amorphous film formation at low temperatures, indicating that single-step co-deposition is unsuitable for crystalline {\alpha}-In2Se3 on Al2O3. Overall, this study validates Bayesian Optimization as a powerful approach for phase-selective growth in complex materials systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13156v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Surface Phonon Hall Viscosity Induced Phonon Chirality and Nonreciprocity in Magnetic Topological Insulator Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13283</link><description>arXiv:2601.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13283v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CatMaster: An Agentic Autonomous System for Computational Heterogeneous Catalysis Research</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13508</link><description>arXiv:2601.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend.
  Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13508v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Faster grain-boundary diffusion with a higher activation enthalpy than bulk diffusion in ionic space-charge layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14181</link><description>arXiv:2601.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster diffusion of cations along grain boundaries is reported in the literature for a variety of acceptor-doped $AB\mathrm{O}_{3}$ perovskite-type oxides. The ratio $r$ of the activation enthalpy of grain-boundary diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{gb}$) to the activation enthalpy of bulk diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{b}$) is seen experimentally to lie in the range $0.7 &lt; r = \Delta H^\mathrm{gb} / \Delta H^\mathrm{b} &lt; 1.3$, albeit with substantial errors. In a previous publication [Parras and De Souza, Acta Mater. 195 (2020) 383] it was shown through a set of continuum simulations that cation-vacancy accumulation within negative space-charge layers at grain boundaries in acceptor-doped perovskites will give rise to faster grain-boundary diffusion of cations, with the associated values of $r$ approaching but not exceeding unity. In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r &gt; 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers. The conditions under which $r &gt; 1$ is observed are described, and issues with experimental confirmation are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14181v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning model for predicting surface wettability in laser-textured metal alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11661</link><description>arXiv:2601.11661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface wettability, governed by both topography and chemistry, plays a critical role in applications such as heat transfer, lubrication, microfluidics, and surface coatings. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11661v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Development of next-generation light-weight ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12836</link><description>arXiv:2601.12836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study reports the design of advanced light-weight materials for high-energy accelerator beampipe applications. The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package. Our results show that, although the elastic moduli ($E$) of the investigated Mg-Al-Li alloys are comparable to those of conventional beampipe materials, their significantly higher radiation lengths ($X_0$) lead to an overall improvement in the figure of merit $X_0 E^{1/3}$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12836v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12941</link><description>arXiv:2601.12941v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \ce{Ti}, \ce{Zr}, and \ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13845v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Information transport and transport-induced entanglement in open fermion chains</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14153</link><description>arXiv:2601.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed "information lattice" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14153v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unveiling pressurized bulk superconductivity in a trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08677</link><description>arXiv:2411.08677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has provided new perspectives on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase, so the discovery of new superconducting RP nickelates is highly desirable to reveal their generality. Here we report that high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal is grown with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure. High-pressure transport measurements show that the superconducting state arises above 10 GPa, and the maximum Tc reaches 39 K without saturation, significantly exceeding the value of 25-30 K of La4Ni3O10. Ultrasensitive d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure indicate bulk superconductivity with appreciable superconducting volume fractions. By performing in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 16 K, a structural transition is found from monoclinic to tetragonal. Unlike La4Ni3O10, the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase of Pr4Ni3O10 from density functional theory exhibits a dramatic metallization of the sigma-bonding band consisting of three dz2 orbitals and van Hove singularity of coupled bands of dx2-y2 orbitals near the Fermi level, similar to the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. These findings reveal some generic features of both crystal and electronic structures for high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates and multi-layer cuprates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.08677v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384</link><description>arXiv:2412.01384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale quantum many-body systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding strongly correlated physics. However, two fundamental problems, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.01384v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Symmetry Discovery for Integrable Hamiltonian Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14632</link><description>arXiv:2412.14632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) framework for identifying continuous symmetry generators and their Lie-algebraic structure directly from phase-space trajectory data expressed in canonical coordinates. MLSD parameterizes candidate conserved quantities with neural networks and learns antisymmetric structure coefficients by enforcing Poisson-bracket closure, supplemented by a weak independence regularizer. We validate MLSD on two integrable benchmark systems -- the three-dimensional Kepler problem and the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator -- recovering the expected non-Abelian algebras (respectively $\mathfrak{so}(4)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$) up to basis transformations. This work focuses on integrable benchmark dynamics, where global conserved quantities are well-defined and admit compact representations learnable from canonical-coordinate trajectories. Extending symmetry discovery to mixed or chaotic phase-space regimes is an important direction for future work.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.14632v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07945</link><description>arXiv:2503.07945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This research advances the exploration of quantum phases driven by strong correlations and the design of materials for next-generation quantum technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.07945v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10211</link><description>arXiv:2506.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO2) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.10211v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Identification of 2D colloidal assemblies in images: a threshold processing method versus machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21634</link><description>arXiv:2510.21634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of identification of colloidal assemblies using the example of two-dimensional coatings (monolayer assemblies). Colloidal systems are used in various fields of science and technology, for example, in applications for photonics and functional coatings. The physical properties depend on the morphology of the structure of the colloidal assemblies. Therefore, effective identification of particle assemblies is of interest. The following classification is considered here: isolated particles, dimers, chains and clusters. We have studied and compared two identification methods: image threshold analysis using the OpenCV library and machine learning using the YOLOv8 model as an example. The features and current results of training a neural network model on a dataset specially prepared for this work are described. A comparative characteristic of both methods is given. The best result was shown by the machine learning method (97% accuracy). The threshold processing method showed an accuracy of about 67%. The developed algorithms and software modules may be useful to scientists and engineers working in the field of materials science in the future.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.21634v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum complexity across thermal phase transition in the transverse field Ising chain with long-range couplings</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13667</link><description>arXiv:2511.13667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Schmidt gap, the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and the non-stabiliserness in proximity to the classical phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model (LRTFIM). Leveraging the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) within a tensor-network formulation, we simulate thermal states through their purified tensor-network representations. Our results show that these observables, typically regarded as hallmarks of quantum criticality, exhibit pronounced and coherent signatures even at a classical thermal transition, highlighting the emergence of quantum complexity as the system nears thermal criticality.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.13667v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Probing the quantum motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator with a radio-frequency superconducting qubit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21481</link><description>arXiv:2505.21481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime are a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated coherent interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of $21~\mathrm{\mu K}$ and read out with 77% single-shot fidelity. During the $6~\mathrm{ms}$ lifetime of the membrane the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective qubit detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the position noise spectrum of the membrane, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at $10~\mathrm{mK}$ and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.21481v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Overcoming disorder in superconducting globally driven quantum computing</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25996</link><description>arXiv:2510.25996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional ladder geometry [R. Menta et al., Phys. Rev. Research 7, L012065 (2025)]. Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit resonant frequencies and coupling strengths affect quantum state propagation and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.25996v2</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Integrating Thermal Liquid Biopsy, Clinical Data, and Mass Spectrometry for Early Diagnosis and Biomarker Discovery in Colorectal Cancer</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(26)00126-4?rss=yes</link><description>Early detection of colorectal cancer is essential to improving survival, where yet current diagnostic tools show limited performance.

Abstract: Accelerating alkali-ion battery discovery requires accurate modeling of atomic-scale kinetics, yet the reliability of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) in capturing these high-energy landscapes remains uncertain. Here, we systematically benchmark state-of-the-art uMLIPs, including M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE, SevenNet, GRACE, and Orb, against DFT baselines for cathodes and solid electrolytes. We find that the Orb-v3 family excels in static migration barrier predictions (MAE $\approx$ 75--111 meV), driven primarily by architectural refinements. Conversely, for dynamic transport, the GRACE model trained on the OMat24 dataset demonstrates superior fidelity in reproducing ion diffusivities and structural correlations. Our results reveal that while architectural sophistication (e.g., equivariance) is beneficial, the inclusion of high-temperature, non-equilibrium training data is the dominant driver of kinetic accuracy. These findings establish that modern uMLIPs are sufficiently robust to serve as zero-shot surrogates for high-throughput kinetic screening of next-generation energy storage materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-driven Prediction of Ionic Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolytes with Machine Learning and Large Language Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10997</link><description>arXiv:2601.10997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are attractive for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to improved safety and stability but their low room-temperature ionic conductivity hinders practical application. Experimental synthesis and testing of new SSEs remain time-consuming and resource intensive. Machine learning (ML) offers an accelerated route for SSE discovery; however, composition-only models neglect structural factors important for ion transport while graph neural networks (GNNs) are challenged by the scarcity of structure-labeled conductivity data and the prevalence of crystallographic disorder in CIFs. Here, we train two complementary predictors on the same room-temperature, structure-labeled dataset (n = 499). A gradient-boosted tree regressor (GBR) combining stoichiometric and geometric descriptors achieves best performance (MAE = 0.543 in log(S cm-1)), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identifies probe-occupiable volume (POAV) and lattice parameters as key correlations for conductivity. In parallel, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using compact text prompts derived from CIF metadata (formula with optional symmetry and disorder tags), avoiding direct use of raw atomic coordinates. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves high accuracy (MAE = 0.657 in log(S cm-1)) using formula and symmetry information, eliminating the need for numerical feature extraction from CIF files. Together, these results show that global geometric descriptors improve tree-based predictions and enable interpretable structure-property analysis, while LLMs provide a competitive low-preprocessing alternative for rapid SSE screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10997v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Computational Design of Ductile Additively Manufactured Tungsten-Based Refractory Alloys</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11295</link><description>arXiv:2601.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tungsten exhibits exceptional temperature and radiation resistance, making it well-suited for applications in extreme environments such as nuclear fusion reactors. Additive manufacturing offers geometrical design freedom and rapid prototyping capabilities for these applications, provided the intrinsic brittleness and low printability of tungsten can be overcome. Designing tungsten alloys with improved ductility, and thus printability in additive manufacturing, can be accelerated using a computationally derived performance predictor to screen out brittle compositions. Calculations of the Pugh ratio using density functional theory may serve this purpose, given its correlation with ductility. This process can be made more efficient through the use of machine learning interatomic potentials to accelerate density functional theory calculations. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning interatomic potentials can effectively identify optimal alloy compositions in the W-Ta-Nb system along the melting point-Pugh ratio Pareto front. The trend in Pugh ratio as a function of tungsten fraction is explained in terms of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. Experimental validation reveals a strong correlation between the computed Pugh ratio and the observed crack fractions in additively manufactured alloys. Notably, the two alloys predicted to have the highest Pugh ratio values, W20Ta70Nb10 and W30Ta60Nb10, exhibit no intergranular microcracking in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11295v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An exciting approach to theoretical spectroscopy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11388</link><description>arXiv:2601.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical spectroscopy, and more generally, electronic-structure theory, are powerful concepts for describing the complex many-body interactions in materials. They comprise a variety of methods that can capture all aspects, from ground-state properties to lattice excitations to different types of light-matter interaction, including time-resolved variants. Modern electronic-structure codes implement either a few or several of these methods. Among them, exciting is an all-electron full-potential package that has a very rich portfolio of all levels of theory, with a particular focus on excitations. It implements the linearized augmented planewave plus local orbital basis, which is known as the gold standard for solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory. Based on this, it also offers benchmark-quality results for a wide range of excited-state methods. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the features implemented in exciting in recent years, accompanied by short summaries on the state of the art of the underlying methodologies. They comprise density-functional theory and time-dependent density-functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory for phonons and electron-phonon coupling, many-body perturbation theory in terms of the $GW$ approach and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Moreover, we capture resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, pump-probe spectroscopy as well as exciton-phonon coupling. Finally, we cover workflows and a view on data and machine learning. All aspects are demonstrated with examples for scientific relevant materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11388v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] NAVIS: A LAMMPS-Python framework for efficient computation of nanochannel velocity and thermal interfacial slip</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11391</link><description>arXiv:2601.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NAVIS (NAnochannel Velocity and thermal Interfacial Slip), a LAMMPS-Python scripted toolkit for computing the Navier (hydrodynamic) friction coefficient and Kapitza (thermal) resistance at arbitrary solid-fluid interfaces. NAVIS is based on equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) methods for calculating the linear response friction and thermal resistance at the interface, as well as the corresponding velocity and temperature slips. The methodology is based on our previous studies (Hansen, et al., Phys. Rev. E 84, 016313 (2011); Varghese et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 184707 (2021); Alosious, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 194502 (2019); Alosious, et al., Langmuir 37, 2355-2361 (2021)), and in this work we provide a pedagogical framework for the implementation of this toolkit on two systems: (i) a water-graphene system (for hydrodynamic slip) and (ii) a water-CNT system (for thermal slip). We provide detailed instructions for performing the EMD simulations using the LAMMPS package and processing the simulation outputs using Python modules to obtain the desired quantities of interest. We expect the toolkit to be useful for computational researchers studying interfacial friction and thermal transport, key factors for efficient and practical applications of nanofluidic systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11391v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Halide diffusion in mixed-halide perovskites and heterojunctions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11503</link><description>arXiv:2601.11503v1 Announce Type: new

We observe enhanced diffusion of both vacancies and interstitials in the mixed halide compounds compared to the single halide ones, as well as a difference in mobility between Br and I ions in the mixed compound. Diffusion across heterojunctions is governed by the interface structure, where a Br-rich interface blocks migration of vacancies in particular, but an I-rich interface is permeable.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11503v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predictive autoencoder-transformer model of Cu oxidation state from EELS and XAS spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11509</link><description>arXiv:2601.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) produce detailed information about oxidation state, bonding, and coordination, making them essential for quantitative studies of redox and structure in functional materials. However, high-throughput quantitative analysis of these spectra, especially for mixed valence materials, remains challenging as diverse experimental conditions introduce noise, misalignment, broadening of the spectral features. We address this challenge by training a machine learning model consisting of an autoencoder to standardize the spectra and a transformer model to predict both Cu oxidation state and Bader charge directly from L-edge spectra. The model is trained on a large dataset of FEFF-simulated spectra and evaluates model performance on both simulated and experimental data. The results of the machine learning model exhibit highly accurate prediction across the domains of simulated and experimental XAS as well as experimental EELS. These advances enable future quantitative analysis of Cu redox processes under in situ and operando conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11509v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Skyrmion Quantum Diode Prototype: Bridging Micromagnetic Simulations and Quantum Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11341</link><description>arXiv:2601.11341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11341v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] On the temperature and density dependence of dislocation drag from phonon wind</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08650</link><description>arXiv:2104.08650v4 Announce Type: replace

Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2410.08294v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02367</link><description>arXiv:2504.02367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.02367v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] pyRMG: A Framework for High-Throughput, Large-Cell DFT Calculations on Supercomputers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16775</link><description>arXiv:2509.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exascale computing delivers the raw power to simulate ever larger and more chemically realistic systems, but realizing this potential requires codes that can efficiently use thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) density functional theory (DFT) code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). However, the limited workflow infrastructure for RMG has thus far constrained its adoption to a small user community. In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE computational materials science Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which offers chemical insights into this system and shows that RMG-based workflows can converge with limited user intervention.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16775v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v2</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Zinc-based metal halide electrolytes for all-solid-state zinc-metal batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68394-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 19 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68394-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68394-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Zinc-metal batteries are restricted by their inherent high activity of aqueous electrolyte.

Abstract: In this work we explore the performance and behavior of reasoning large language models to autonomously optimize atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09980v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Advanced Manufacturing with Renewable and Bio-based Materials: AI/ML workflows and Process Optimization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10382</link><description>arXiv:2601.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced manufacturing with new bio-derived materials can be achieved faster and more economically with first-principle-based artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-derived models and process optimization. Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10382v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Generalizable Framework for Building Executable Domain-Specific LLMs under Data Scarcity: Demonstration on Semiconductor TCAD Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10128</link><description>arXiv:2601.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific and engineering verticals often suffer from data scarcity and strict executability requirements: models must generate not only fluent text, but also syntactically valid, tool-compilable scripts. We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR-&gt;DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models.
  We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR-&gt;DPO) are released for reproducibility. Together, these results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust and reproducible path toward executable LLMs in specialized, data-scarce professional domains.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10128v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Molecular electrostatic potentials from machine learning models for dipole and quadrupole predictions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10320</link><description>arXiv:2601.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10320v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interfacial Behavior from the Atomic Blueprint: Machine Learning-Guided Design of Spatially Functionalized a-SiO2 Surfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20929</link><description>arXiv:2504.20929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: a-Quartz surfaces functionalized with hydroxyl and methyl groups provide a versatile platform for controlling interfacial properties critical to applications such as catalysis, protective coatings, and energy conversion. The arrangement of these functional groups strongly influences interfacial interactions at solid-liquid interfaces, highlighting their relevance to colloid and interface science. However, conventional models often treat surface functionalization as spatially homogeneous, overlooking the atomic-scale organization of surface groups. We hypothesize that this spatial distribution, beyond overall composition, plays a decisive role in governing surface stability and interfacial behavior.
  To test this hypothesis, we employ a multi-scale simulation workflow combining density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and machine-learned force fields (MLFFs). This approach allows us to explore a range of spatial patterns of OH/CH3 functionalization on the a-quartz (0001) surface. We evaluate the impact of spatial arrangements on mixing energy, hydrogen bonding networks, and vibrational properties with high accuracy and robustness.
  Our results reveal that spatial patterning strongly influences surface stability and interfacial structure. A thermodynamically favored unpaired configuration emerges near 67 % CH3 substitution, where isolated OH groups form secondary hydrogen bonds through reorientation toward subsurface oxygen atoms. This rearrangement induces a characteristic blue shift in OH stretching frequencies, indicating weaker H-bonding. These effects are absent in clustered arrangements. By establishing a clear link between functional group patterning and interfacial behavior, our work uncovers the underlying mechanisms to guide and accelerate the rational design of silica-based materials and coatings, directly relevant to colloid and interface science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.20929v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Discovering quasiorder parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06159</link><description>arXiv:2505.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these quantities, along with a magnetization-like quantity derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative (quasi)order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results clarify, within this specific setting, how reduced spin representations can retain the essential thermodynamic information needed for identifying critical behavior. Taken together, this work establishes a concrete bridge between Ising-trained ML models and critical phenomena in Potts systems by showing that Potts criticality can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, thereby opening avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.06159v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Influence of Exchange-Correlation Functionals and Neural Network Architectures on Li$^+$-Ion Conductivity in Solid-State Electrolyte from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Machine-Learning Force Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11650</link><description>arXiv:2512.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques for materials simulations, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have become a powerful tool that complements first-principles calculations by enabling high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations over extended timescales. Typically, MLFFs are trained on data generated from density functional theory (DFT) using a specific exchange-correlation (XC) functional, with the goal of reproducing DFT-level properties. However, the uncertainties in MLFF-based simulations--arising from variations in both MLFF model architectures and the choice of XC functionals--remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we construct MLFF models of different architectures trained on DFT data from both semilocal and hybrid functionals to describe Li$^+$ diffusion in the solid-state electrolyte Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl. We systematically investigate how different XC functionals influence the Li$^+$ diffusion coefficient. To reduce statistical uncertainty, the mean squared displacements are averaged over 300 independent molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of 70 ps each, yielding statistical variations below $1\%$. This enables a clear assessment of the respective influences of the functional and the MLFF model. Due to its tendency to underestimate band gaps and migration barriers, the semilocal functional predicts consistently higher Li$^+$ diffusion coefficients, compared to the hybrid functional. Furthermore, comparisons among various neural network methods reveal that the differences in predicted diffusion coefficients arising from different network architectures are of the same order of magnitude as those caused by different functionals, indicating that the choice of the network model itself substantially influences the MLFF predictions. This observation calls from an urgent need for standardized protocols to minimize model-dependent biases in MLFF-based MD.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.11650v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A survey of active learning in materials science: Data-driven paradigm for accelerating the research pipeline</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06971</link><description>arXiv:2601.06971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.
  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.
  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially AI agents, is increasingly being applied to chemistry, healthcare, and manufacturing to enhance productivity. In this review, we discuss the progress of AI and agentic AI in areas related to, and beyond polymer materials and discovery chemistry. More specifically, the focus is on the need for efficient discovery, core concepts, and large language models. Consequently, applications are showcased in scenarios such as (1) flow chemistry, (2) biosensors, and (3) batteries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09027v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link><description>arXiv:2601.09705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09705v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link><description>arXiv:2411.02740v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02740v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum circuit complexity and unsupervised machine learning of topological order</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04486</link><description>arXiv:2508.04486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. We argue that Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity represents an intrinsic topological distance between topological quantum many-body phases of matter, and as such plays a central role in interpretable manifold learning of topological order. To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with quantum Fisher complexity (Bures distance) and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed distance measures, unsupervised manifold learning of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, is conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Moreover, we find that the entanglement-based approach, which captures the long-range structure of quantum entanglement of topological orders, is more robust to local Haar random noises. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, quantum metrology, and machine learning of topological quantum order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.04486v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] YBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3.5+δ&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;: A family of semiconductors with a charge- and defect-tunable triple fluorite layer</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-m3qv9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Abstract: The design and development of new materials is crucial for advanced next-generation technologies, necessitating the modification of materials with tuneable atomic and electronic frameworks.

Specifically, the redox inert nature of these cations, even within some intermetallic compounds, enables one to access exotic oxidation states. Prior work on semiconducting alkali aurides(I-) and platinides(II-) containing transition metal anions stimulated theoretical predictions of the monatomic iridide(III-) anion by reduction of iridium with alkali metals under pressure. We tested these predictions by reacting a K-rich mixture of K and Ir at 19.5(6) GPa and 493 K. This reaction yields K5Ir, which adopts the rare but simple BaSn5 crystal structure. Hybrid functional electronic structure calculations, net atomic charge analysis, and Ir L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal K5Ir is a semimetal with a carrier density ~10^20 cm^−3 which features anionic Ir and both cationic and neutral K on different sites. While the net atomic charge of Ir in K5Ir falls short of that in hypothetical, semiconducting K3Ir, it exceeds those of Pt(II-) in Cs2Pt and Ir(III-) in [Ir(CO)3]^3−, suggesting an extreme for the distribution of charge in the vicinity of a transition metal. First-principles crystal structure prediction corroborates the thermodynamic stability of K5Ir under the preparatory conditions and indicates that several other K−Ir compounds await discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-xfdj1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Nanopore sequencing with proteins: synchronization and dischronization of molecular dynamics simulations with laboratory and industrial developments</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0lzw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Protein nanopores have revolutionized DNA sequencing by enabling long-read, real-time, and portable genomic analysis. This review traces the experimental evolution of three key protein nanopores—α-hemolysin, MspA, and CsgG—highlighting how iterative engineering overcame challenges such as translocation control and homopolymer resolution. Concurrently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have elucidated DNA–pore interactions, ion current modulation, free-energy landscapes, and so forth, providing mechanistic insights and guiding rational design. However, MD studies consistently lag behind experimental and industrial advances, resulting in a reactive “simulate-after-validate” paradigm. We identify critical gaps in simulating motor–pore complexes, experimental timescales, and emerging designs like dual-constriction pores. To bridge these, we propose leveraging deep learning-based structure prediction, de novo protein design, and advanced multiscale simulations to foster proactive, integrated development of next-generation nanopore technologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0lzw1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Surface Segregation in Compositionally Complex Ag-Au-Pd-Pt Solid Solutions: Insights from High-Throughput Experimentation and Atomistic Simulations</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-xbjnn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The activity of compositionally complex electrocatalysts depends on their surface composition, which can be different from the volume composition. In solid solutions, surface segregation under vacuum can be estimated based on the surface energy of the constituent elements. Upon exposure to ambient conditions, the surface reactivity of the elements, particularly their tendency to oxidize, is also important. Here, we investigate differences between the surface and volume composition of a model noble metal system, Ag-Au-Pd-Pt, fabricated by co-sputter deposition in the form of thin-film materials libraries (MLs), spanning a compositional range of Ag12-55Au7-50Pd6-60Pt7-58. The volume compositions of 684 measurement areas of these libraries were determined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). For each library, a set of nine selected areas was additionally measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to determine the surface compositions, i.e. the first few nanometers of the films. The XPS data reveal surface segregation of Ag up to 8 at.% and Pt depletion of similar magnitude. The results were further validated by large-scale molecular dynamics/Monte-Carlo simulations using accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP), providing theoretical insights of surface segregation under vacuum conditions across the quaternary composition space.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-xbjnn?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Assignment Promoting Use of Generative AI as an Active Learning Tool in General Chemistry</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7wwr0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for teaching and learning is currently hotly debated. Concerns regarding the accuracy of information produced by generative AI as well as student over-reliance on this tool coexist with excitement about tailored opportunities that AI may provide for educational purposes. Student ability to responsibly utilize AI is growing into a key competency that we expect can be co-taught with domain course contents. Driven by this idea, we developed an assignment for first-year undergraduate students in a general chemistry course with the aim to promote the use of AI as an active learning tool. By having students judge AI responses to advanced chemistry-related questions, this assignment is designed to promote the assessment of information accuracy and combat over-reliance. Here, we detail the assignment and report the aggregate student responses that we received while implementing this assignment in our course.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-7wwr0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Auditing Domain Alignment in Latent Representations for Cross-Domain Materials Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d4qw9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Machine learning models are increasingly applied to heterogeneous materials datasets spanning different synthesis routes, measurement protocols, and structural classes. Although multi-task and representation-learning approaches are commonly used to improve predictive performance, the latent representations learned by such models are rarely examined directly, allowing domain misalignment to remain hidden until model transfer fails. Here, we present a practical, representation-level framework for auditing domain alignment in latent spaces learned by multi-task neural networks for materials property prediction. Using porous carbon materials and metal–organic frameworks as a representative cross-domain case study, we analyze a shared latent space trained across multiple target properties and regularization strategies. Global and local dimensionality-reduction visualizations are combined with quantitative measures of domain separability and latent–target correlation structure to assess alignment quality. We find that domain-alignment objectives induce measurable geometric reorganization and partial large-scale mixing in latent space, while domain identity remains locally recoverable and physically interpretable monotonic associations between latent dimensions and target properties are preserved. These diagnostics reveal structural differences in learned representations that are not apparent from conventional performance metrics alone and enable model comparison based on latent-space geometry rather than predictive accuracy. The proposed auditing framework is model-agnostic and can be readily integrated into existing materials machine learning workflows, providing a practical tool for improving robustness and interpretability in cross-domain materials modeling.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-d4qw9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Asymmetric Multi-Site Ion Exchange in Porous Carbon Electrodes</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-jvqt4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ion transport in porous carbon electrodes underpins the performance of electrochemical energy-storage and separation technologies, yet exchange dynamics within heterogeneous pore networks remain difficult to quantify. Here, we present a rigorous analytical framework for extracting quantitative ion-exchange kinetics in confined electrolytes from two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy (2D EXSY) NMR, explicitly accounting for asymmetric ion populations, relaxation effects, and microscopic reversibility. By describing exchange with a lognormal distribution of rates, the framework captures the intrinsic heterogeneity of ion motion and overcomes the limitations of conventional discrete-site models. Applied to aqueous LiTFSI electrolytes confined in mesoporous CMK-3 and hierarchically structured ST-CMK-3 carbons, the method resolves a hierarchy of ion-exchange processes spanning fast near-surface exchange to slow in-pore diffusion in two and three-site exchange systems. We report the first observation of three-site ion exchange in porous electrodes, revealing enhanced directional ion mobility and higher effective diffusion coefficients at interconnected micro–mesopore boundaries in hierarchical carbons. These findings establish direct, quantitative links between pore architecture and ion-transport efficiency. This distribution-based framework provides a generalizable route to identifying rate-limiting transport pathways in complex porous energy materials and offers design principles for optimizing porous carbons for high-rate supercapacitors, capacitive deionization, and gas-storage applications.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-jvqt4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Materials] Heterogeneous doping via nanoscale coating impacts the mechanics of Li intrusion in brittle solid electrolytes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02465-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Materials, Published online: 16 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02465-7"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41563-025-02465-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Short-circuiting during fast charging through lithium dendrite intrusion into electrolytes is a major challenge in solid-state batteries.

Additionally, since oxygen excess is well known in Ruddlesden–Popper oxides but its impact on fluoride-ion transport has not been previously investigated, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to reveal how oxygen over-stoichiometry affects fluoride intercalation mechanisms and energetics, unveiling new migration pathways that hinder fluoride mobility.

However, poor room-temperature ionic conductivity has historically limited their use in practical applications. Here, we substitute Zr4+ into Li2ZnCl4 along the series Li2−2x/3Zn1−xZr2x/3Cl4 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.0) to understand how cation disorder and vacancy tuning impacts ion transport in “normal” halospinels. Aliovalent Zr4+ substitution increases ionic conductivity by nearly five orders of magnitude, from 1.320(3) × 10−9 S cm−1 in Li2ZnCl4 to 6.74(1) × 10−5 S cm−1 for x = 0.6. Average and local structure characterization through synchrotron X-ray diffraction
(SXRD) and neutron pair distribution function (nPDF) analysis reveal that Zr4+ redistributes the Zn2+ and Li+ sublattices into previously unoccupied interstitial sites that form new low-energy hopping pathways that facilitate ion transport. We rationalize the dramatic rearrangement of the cation local structure by considering the coordination
preferences of the cations and the potential electrostatic penalties incurred by the higher-valent Zr4+ cations. This work delivers an atomistic understanding of substitution-induced cation disorder and ion transport properties in a new family of earth-abundant halospinels.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zw0j8?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] OBELiX: A Curated Dataset of Crystal Structures and Experimentally Measured Ionic Conductivities for Lithium Solid-State Electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00441A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00441A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Felix Therrien, Jamal Abou Haibeh, Divya  Sharma, Rhiannon  Hendley, Leah Wairimu Mungai, Sun  Sun, Alain Tchagang, Jiang  Su, Samuel  Huberman, Yoshua Bengio, Hongyu Guo, Alex Hernandez-Garcia, Homin Shin&lt;br /&gt;Solid-state electrolyte batteries are expected to replace liquid electrolyte lithium-ion batteries in the near future thanks to their higher theoretical energy density and improved safety.

Large-scale benchmarking studies using public datasets have demonstrated the feasibility of building predictive models across hundreds of endpoints. In parallel, automated machine learning (Auto-ML) approaches have emerged as a promising means to lower the barrier to QSAR model development, enabling competitive performance without extensive expert intervention. 
Here, we describe the design and implementation of an automated QSAR modeling system inte- grated into the CDD Vault platform, referred to as CDD Vault Inference Models. The system auto- matically trains, evaluates, and deploys regression models whenever new assay data become available, without requiring users to select endpoints, descriptors, or learning algorithms. Using public datasets from ChEMBL, we developed a fully automated workflow for model training and continuous evaluation. Models are released when a conservative performance threshold is achieved. The system is currently focused on building regression models. To give users a handle on model uncertainty, we also provide conformal prediction intervals. 
We discuss the implications of deploying fully automated QSAR models in a production environ- ment and outline future extensions. Together, this work demonstrates that automated, continuously updated QSAR modeling can provide practical and scalable decision support for drug discovery, par- ticularly in settings where dedicated modeling expertise is limited.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-l1d11?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] pyEF: A Python Framework for QM and QM/MM Atom-Wise Electric Field Analysis</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3cbg4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>We introduce pyEF, a software package for computing molecular electric fields, electrostatic interaction energies, and electrostatic potentials from quantum mechanical (QM) atom-centered multipole expansions with atom-wise decomposable contributions. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and accuracy of this QM-derived electric field evaluation tool through several tests. To assess the influence of the underlying QM method and charge partitioning scheme on these electrostatic quantities, we analyze over 250 configurations of an acetone solute molecule in five solvents of variable polarity. We find that electric field calculations are highly sensitive to the choice of charge partitioning method. Even among real-space charge schemes, acetone Stark tuning rates differ by up to a factor of two. Benchmarking computed solvent dipole moments against experimental bulk values, we conclude that the CM5, ADCH, and Hirshfeld-I charge schemes most reliably capture solvent electrostatics and therefore provide a more faithful foundation for computing electric fields. When constructed from these real-space charges, electric fields are nearly insensitive to basis set size and monotonically increase in magnitude with higher Fock exchange. We also demonstrate efficient convergence of QM electrostatics when more distant molecules are represented solely by MM point charges, reducing computational overhead. Leveraging these findings, we demonstrate the use of pyEF to deduce environmental effects on a transition metal complex from a Ga4L612- nanocage and quantify the dominant role of organic linkers in orchestrating electrostatic preorganization.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-3cbg4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] “Active material-free” design to overcome mass-transport limitations for high-energy-density all-solid-state Li-S batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00420-9?rss=yes</link><description>Artificially preloading active materials cannot guarantee effective three-phase contact, where the ionic conductors, electronic conductors, and active materials meet, making it difficult to achieve efficient sulfur utilization.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators provide a powerful platform for realizing strongly correlated phases, enabling access to dynamical signatures of quasiparticles and symmetry breaking processes. Motivated by recent observations of quantum phases in flux-frustrated ladders with non-vanishing ground state currents, we investigate interacting bosons on the dimerized BBH lattice in two dimensions-originally introduced in the context of higher-order topology. After mapping out the phase diagram, which includes vortex superfluid (V-SF), vortex Mott insulator (V-MI), and featureless Mott insulator (MI) phases, we focus on the integer filling case. There, the MI/V-SF transition simultaneously breaks the $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ and U(1) symmetries, where $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ corresponds to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Using a slave-boson description, we resolve the excitation spectrum across the transition and uncover a chiral Higgs mode whose mass softens at criticality, providing a dynamical hallmark of emergent chirality that we numerically probe via quench dynamics. Our results establish an experimentally realistic setting for probing unconventional TRS-broken phases and quasiparticles with intrinsic chirality in strongly interacting quantum matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08925v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning-Driven Creep Law Discovery Across Alloy Compositional Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08970</link><description>arXiv:2601.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hihg-temperature creep characterization of structural alloys traditionally relies on serial uniaxial tests, which are highly inefficient for exploring the large search space of alloy compositions and for material discovery. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-assisted, high-throughput framework for creep law identification based on a dimple array bulge instrument (DABI) configuration, which enables parallel creep testing of 25 dimples, each fabricated from a different alloy, in a single experiment. Full-field surface displacements of dimples undergoing time-dependent creep-induced bulging under inert gas pressure are measured by 3D digital image correlation. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a surrogate model, mapping creep parameters and loading conditions to the time-dependent deformation response of DABI. Coupling this surrogate with a particle swarm optimization scheme enables rapid and global inverse identification with sparsity regularization of creep parameters from experiment displacement-time histories. In addition, we propose a phenomenological creep law with a time-dependent stress exponent that captures the sigmoidal primary creep observed in wrought INCONEL 625 and extracts its temperature dependence from DABI test at multiple temperatures. Furthermore, we employ a general creep law combining several conventional forms together with regularized inversion to identify the creep laws for 47 additional Fe-, Ni-, and Co-rich alloys and to automatically select the dominant functional form for each alloy. This workflow combined with DABI experiment provides a quantitative, high-throughput creep characterization platform that is compatible with data mining, composition-property modeling, and nonlinear structural optimization with creep behavior across a large alloy design space.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08970v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Agentic AI and Machine Learning for Accelerated Materials Discovery and Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09027</link><description>arXiv:2601.09027v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Phonons, quantized vibrations of the atomic lattice, are fundamental to understanding thermal transport, structural stability, and phase behavior in crystalline solids. Despite advances in computational materials science, most predictions of vibrational properties in large materials databases rely on the harmonic approximation and overlook crucial temperature-dependent anharmonic effects. Here, we present a scalable computational framework that combines machine learning interatomic potentials, anharmonic lattice dynamics, and high-throughput calculations to investigate temperature-dependent phonons across thousands of materials. By fine-tuning the universal M3GNet interatomic potential using high-quality phonon data, we improve phonon prediction accuracy by a factor of four while preserving computational efficiency. Integrating this refined model into a high-throughput implementation of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we compute temperature-dependent phonons for 4,669 inorganic compounds. Our analysis identifies systematic elemental and structural trends governing anharmonic phonon renormalization, with particularly strong manifestations in alkali metals, perovskite-derived frameworks, and related systems. Machine learning models trained on this dataset identify key atomic-scale features driving strong anharmonicity, including weak bonding, large atomic radii, and specific coordination motifs. First-principles validation confirms that anharmonic effects can dramatically alter lattice thermal conductivity by factors of two to four in some materials. This work establishes a robust and efficient data-driven approach for predicting finite-temperature phonon behavior, offering new pathways for the design and discovery of materials with tailored thermal and vibrational properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09123v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Field report from Collaborative Research Center 1625: Heterogeneous research data management using ontology representations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09359</link><description>arXiv:2601.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the Collaborative Research Center 1625 is the establishment of a scientific basis for the atomic-scale understanding and design of multifunctional compositionally complex solid solution surfaces. Next to materials synthesis in form of thin-film materials libraries, various materials characterization and simulations techniques are used to explore the materials data space of the problem. Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques guide its exploration and navigation. The effective use of the combined heterogeneous data requires more than just a simple research data management plan. Consequently, our research data management system maps different data modalities in different formats and resolutions from different labs to the correct spatial locations on physical samples. Besides a graphical user interface, the system can also be accessed through an application programming interface for reproducible data-driven workflows. It is implemented by a combination of a custom research data management system designed around a relational database, an ontology which builds upon materials science-specific ontologies, and the construction of a Knowledge Graph. Along with the technical solutions of research data management system and lessons learned, first use cases are shown which were not possible (or at least much harder to achieve) without it.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09359v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Revisiting Jahn--Teller Transitions in Correlated Oxides with Monte Carlo Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09705</link><description>arXiv:2601.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jahn--Teller (JT) distortions are a key driver of physical properties in many correlated oxide materials. Cooperative JT distortions, in which long-range orbital order reduces the symmetry of the average structure macroscopically, are common in JT-distorted materials at low temperatures. This long-range order will often melt on heating, \textit{via} a transition to a high-temperature state without long-range orbital order. The nature of this transition has been observed to vary with different materials depending on crystal structure; in LaMnO$_3$ the transition has generally been interpreted as order-disorder, whereas in layered nickelates $A$NiO$_2$ ($A$=Li,Na) there is a displacive transition. Alternatively, recent theoretical work has suggested that previous attributions of order-disorder may in fact be a consequence of phonon anharmonicity, rather than persistence of JT distortions, which would suggest that the displacive transition may be more common than currently believed. In this work, we run Monte Carlo simulations with a simple Hamiltonian which is modified to include terms dependent on the JT amplitude $\rho$, which is allowed to vary within the simulation \textit{via} the Metropolis algorithm. Our simulations yield distributions of JT amplitudes consistent with displacive rather than order-disorder behaviour for both perovskites and layered nickelates, suggesting that displacive-like JT transitions may be more common than previously assumed in both perovskites and layered nickelates. We also find significant differences between the transition observed for perovskites compared with layered nickelates, which we attribute to differing extensivity of configurational entropy on the two lattices, showing the crucial role of lattice geometry in determining behaviour.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09705v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models for Metal-Organic Frameworks Structure Prediction</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09285</link><description>arXiv:2601.09285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials with broad applications such as carbon capture and drug delivery, yet accurately predicting their 3D structures remains a significant challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MOF-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art denoising-based and LLM-based methods while exhibiting superior sampling efficiency.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09285v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning aided parameter analysis in Perovskite X-ray Detector</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04729</link><description>arXiv:2405.04729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many factors in perovskite X-ray detectors, such as crystal lattice and carrier dynamics, determine the final device performance (e.g., sensitivity and detection limit). However, the relationship between these factors remains unknown due to the complexity of the material. In this study, we employ machine learning to reveal the relationship between 15 intrinsic properties of halide perovskite materials and their device performance. We construct a database of X-ray detectors for the training of machine learning. The results show that the band gap is mainly influenced by the atomic number of the B-site metal, and the lattice length parameter b has the greatest impact on the carrier mobility-lifetime product ({\mu}{\tau}). An X-ray detector (m-F-PEA)2PbI4 were generated in the experiment and it further verified the accuracy of our ML models. We suggest further study on random forest regression for X-ray detector applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.04729v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link><description>arXiv:2506.08112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials, the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover small amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.08112v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Data-Driven Review and Machine Learning Prediction of Diamond Vacancy Center Synthesis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02808</link><description>arXiv:2507.02808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here, we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.02808v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Investigating Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04843</link><description>arXiv:2510.04843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04843v2</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage] Design of corrosion resistant Ce-enhanced hybrid solid electrolyte interphase by Ce(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; additives for lithium metal batteries</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X26001465?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: 10 March 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of Energy Storage, Volume 150&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Mingdong Du, Yanxia Liu, Chenxing Wang, Fulai Qi, Mingyu Shi, Wenjing Liu, Shengnan He, Zhijun Wu, Zhenglong Li, Chenchen Li, Hongge Pan&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>ScienceDirect Publication: Journal of Energy Storage</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:41:46 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X26001465</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Assigning the Stereochemistry of Natural Products by Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zz9pw-v4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nature has settled for L-chirality for proteinogenic amino acids and D-chirality for the carbohydrate backbone of nucleotides. Further stereochemical patterns exist among natural products produced by common biosynthetic pathways. Here we asked the question whether these regularities might be sufficiently prevalent among natural products (NPs) such that their stereochemistry could be machine learned and assigned automatically. Indeed, we report that a language model can be trained to assign the stereochemistry of NPs using the open access NP database COCONUT. In detail, our language model, called NPstereo, translates an NP structure written as absolute SMILES into the corresponding isomeric SMILES notation containing stereochemical information, with 80.2% per-stereocenter accuracy for full assignments and 85.9% per-stereocenter accuracy for partial assignments, across various NP classes including secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, polyketides, lipids and terpenes. NPstereo might be useful to assign or correct the stereochemistry of newly discovered NPs. Scientific contribution: Our study reports that a language model, NPstereo, can learn and predict the stereochemistry of natural products (NPs) from their 2D structures with high accuracy. This work demonstrates that NP stereochemical patterns are machine learnable from data and represents a first step for scalable computational methodologies for stereochemical assignment of newly discovered NPs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zz9pw-v4?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Advancing Calcium-Ion Batteries with a Novel Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hxjcm-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ca-ion batteries (CIBs) have garnered significant attention in the past few years by virtue of their economic and physicochemical advantages, positioning them as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology in the post-lithium-ion battery era. However, the current research progress is insufficient, leaving this emerging field far from practical application, most of which focuses on developing high-performance electrode materials. Herein, we design a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) prepared by mixing Ca(ClO4)2·4H2O and acetamide at room temperature. The solvation structure of Ca2+ can be precisely regulated by controlling the molar ratio of the two chemical components. The HEE with optimal formulation features a wide electrochemical stability window, good ionic conductivity, appropriate viscosity, and a low melting point. Employing this novel HEE, a full CIB assembled with a PEDOT/V2O5 cathode and a PTCDI anode demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performance at room temperature (30 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1 after 30,000 cycles) and environmental adaptability within a wide operating temperature range (−20 to 60 ℃). This work may not only provide a sustainable, safe, and cost-effective electrolyte for CIBs but also pave the way for the comprehensive development of CIBs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-hxjcm-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] DFT-guided discovery of bisureido ester of 2-(methylthio)ethanol: A novel lead against triple-negative breast cancer inducing apoptosis via pH-sensitive chloride transport</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tql3f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Dysregulation of transmembrane chloride flux has emerged as a promising strategy for inducing cancer-cell death through disruption of intracellular pH gradients and subsequent apoptosis. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of novel ortho-phenylenediamine (o-PDA) bisurea derivatives bearing carboxyl (5a–f) and 2-(methylthio)ethyl ester (6a,b) groups for pH-sensitive anion transport and resultant anticancer activity. Esterification of 5c–f proved synthetically challenging due to an unprecedented CDI-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization that yielded the 4-oxo-benzo[d][1,3,6]oxadiazepines 8a,b, rationalized via a DFT-supported four-step mechanism involving hydrogen-borrowing catalysis. All target compounds demonstrated 1:1 chloride ion-binding as shown by 1H NMR titration results and demonstrated a pH-gradient-induced transmembrane chloride transport (as shown by vesicular transport studies) which was enhanced by electron-withdrawing substituents on the outer phenyl rings. Ester derivatives 6a,b exhibited significantly higher chloride binding and up to ~67-fold increased transport efficiency over their carboxylic acid analogs. Compound 6b emerged as the lead, combining efficient chloride binding (Ka = 163 M⁻¹), potent transport (EC50 = 0.007 mol%), and superior antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 6.34 µM) against MDA-MB-231 cells via apoptosis induction. These findings establish 6b as a promising lead for chloride-transport-mediated cancer therapy, with further optimization recommended via EWG diversification and strategic consideration of the cyclization pathway in retrosynthetic design.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tql3f?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Nanotechnology] Superionic composite electrolytes with continuously perpendicular-aligned pathways for pressure-less all-solid-state lithium batteries</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02106-9</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Nanotechnology, Published online: 15 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02106-9"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41565-025-02106-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Highly ionically conductive and flexible solid-state composite battery electrolytes are engineered by alternately stacking inorganic LixMyPS3 (M = Cd or Mn) nanosheets with lithium-containing organic polymers in a perpendicular orientation to the surface of the electrodes.</description><author>Nature Nanotechnology</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-02106-9</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Mechanistically guided residual learning for battery state monitoring throughout life</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67565-z</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 15 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67565-z"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67565-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ensuring accurate state monitoring is vital for battery safety and efficiency in electric vehicles.

Nowadays, researchers find it increasingly straightforward to predict a wide range of molecular properties and chemi- cal processes at reasonable computational cost. The resulting abundance of data, generated by quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics sim- ulations, and chemical machine learning natu- rally raises questions about accuracy, precision, and reliability, as well as the systematic treat- ment of errors and uncertainties. Addressing these questions through rigorous mathematical frameworks is at the heart of Uncertainty Quan- tification. In the past years, the incorpora- tion of uncertainty quantification into in silico chemistry has gained attraction, motivated by its ability to provide deeper insights into chem- ical phenomena. In this review, we establish a common language for uncertainty quantifica- tion with respect to in silico chemistry, intro- duce the key mathematical formalisms, and sur- vey the growing body of work that applies un- certainty quantification across different areas of in silico chemistry.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-67ck9-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Practical integration of machine learning into ab initio calculations and workflows: Accelerating the SCF cycle via density matrix predictions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xn2mp-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Data-driven approaches offer great potential for accelerating ab initio electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials but their transferability is often limited due to the vast amount of data needed for training, including when addressing the need to fine-tune universal models for each specific system to be studied. Here, we demonstrate how contributions from system-specific electronic structure machine learning (ESML) models may be combined (“stitched”) to deliver density matrices of entire systems of interest, improving the initial guess for the self-consistent field cycle and delivering gains in computational efficiency. The “stitching” of density matrices is demonstrated for sequential calculations, such as geometry optimization and molecular dynamics, and we show that the synergistic use of ESML models and density matrix extrapolation algorithms can accelerate standard computational calculations. The algorithms are demonstrated for test cases relating to water clusters and a methane clathrate cage, with the benefits discussed. The future opportunities for hybrid quantum mechanical and ML (QM/ML), and also ML/ML paradigms, are broad-ranging with significant computational speed-up attainable.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-xn2mp-v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Letters Current Issue] Coherent transport in strongly correlated perovskite-manganite quantum wells</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/128/2/022405/3377510/Coherent-transport-in-strongly-correlated</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Perovskite transition metal oxides (TMOs) are hallmark systems for studying electron correlations, with strong Coulomb interactions reaching the electron volt scale.

In this Letter, we report the emergence of oscillatory conduction in tunnel diodes incorporating an epitaxial thin LSMO layer—a phenomenon not previously observed in strongly correlated oxides. The observed oscillations originate from discrete quantum-well states formed via quantum confinement, indicating coherent transport across the LSMO layer. These quantum-well states are quantitatively explained using a tight-binding model tailored for the electronic structure of LSMO.

We report atomic-scale &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in situ&lt;/span&gt; TEM studies of delithiation and lithiation in multi-particle LFP coupled to a Li-rich garnet (LLZNO) solid electrolyte. During delithiation, LFP converts to a metastable L&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;FP via a periodicity-doubling mechanism (every second layer) accompanied by the emergence of a solid-solution zone, and we directly observe interparticle Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport that drives reversible LFP–L&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;FP–LFP cycles. Conversely, under reductive bias, lithiation proceeds by an interface-dominated crystalline–amorphous transformation, identifying amorphization as a primary particle-level failure pathway.

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi surface area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring whenever $\Phi$ crosses integer values. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little--Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08055v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symmetry-aware Conditional Generation of Crystal Structures Using Diffusion Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08115</link><description>arXiv:2601.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of generative models in crystal structure prediction (CSP) has gained significant attention. Conditional generation--particularly the generation of crystal structures with specified stability or other physical properties has been actively researched for material discovery purposes. Meanwhile, the generative models capable of symmetry-aware generation are also under active development, because space group symmetry has a strong relationship with the physical properties of materials. In this study, we demonstrate that the symmetry control in the previous conditional crystal generation model may not be sufficiently effective when space group constraints are applied as a condition. To address this problem, we propose the WyckoffDiff-Adaptor, which embeds conditional generation within a WyckoffDiff architecture that effectively diffuses Wyckoff positions to achieve precise symmetry control. We successfully generated formation energy phase diagrams while specifying stable structures of particular combination of elements, such as Li--O and Ti--O systems, while simultaneously preserving the symmetry of the input conditions. The proposed method with symmetry-aware conditional generation demonstrates promising results as an effective approach to achieving the discovery of novel materials with targeted physical properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08115v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A microscopic origin for the breakdown of the Stokes Einstein relation in ion transport</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08309</link><description>arXiv:2601.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion transport underlies the operation of biological ion channels and governs the performance of electrochemical energy-storage devices. A long-standing anomaly is that smaller alkali metal ions, such as Li$^+$, migrate more slowly in water than larger ions, in apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This breakdown is conventionally attributed to dielectric friction, a collective drag force arising from electrostatic interactions between a drifting ion and its surrounding solvent. Here, combining nanopore transport measurements over electric fields spanning several orders of magnitude with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the time-averaged electrostatic force on a migrating ion is not a drag force but a net driving force. By contrasting charged ions with neutral particles, we reveal that ionic charge introduces additional Lorentzian peaks in the frequency-dependent friction coefficient. These peaks originate predominantly from short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions within the first hydration layer and represent additional channels for energy dissipation, strongest for Li$^+$ and progressively weaker for Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions primarily act to tighten the local hydration structure, thereby amplifying short-range LJ interactions rather than directly opposing ion motion. This microscopic mechanism provides a unified physical explanation for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in aqueous ion transport.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08309v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DataScribe: An AI-Native, Policy-Aligned Web Platform for Multi-Objective Materials Design and Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07966</link><description>arXiv:2601.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of materials discovery requires digital platforms that go beyond data repositories to embed learning, optimization, and decision-making directly into research workflows. We introduce DataScribe, an AI-native, cloud-based materials discovery platform that unifies heterogeneous experimental and computational data through ontology-backed ingestion and machine-actionable knowledge graphs. The platform integrates FAIR-compliant metadata capture, schema and unit harmonization, uncertainty-aware surrogate modeling, and native multi-objective multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization, enabling closed-loop propose-measure-learn workflows across experimental and computational pipelines. DataScribe functions as an application-layer intelligence stack, coupling data governance, optimization, and explainability rather than treating them as downstream add-ons. We validate the platform through case studies in electrochemical materials and high-entropy alloys, demonstrating end-to-end data fusion, real-time optimization, and reproducible exploration of multi-objective trade spaces. By embedding optimization engines, machine learning, and unified access to public and private scientific data directly within the data infrastructure, and by supporting open, free use for academic and non-profit researchers, DataScribe functions as a general-purpose application-layer backbone for laboratories of any scale, including self-driving laboratories and geographically distributed materials acceleration platforms, with built-in support for performance, sustainability, and supply-chain-aware objectives.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07966v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v4</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Sequence-based generative AI design of versatile tryptophan synthases</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68384-6</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 14 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68384-6"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68384-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Enzymes are highly selective and sustainable catalysts for chemical synthesis, but their optimization is often limited by the difficulty of identifying functional starting points.

Here, we demonstrate a mixed-halide strategy to enhance the ionic conductivity of lithium tetrahaloaluminates, LiAlX4 (X = Cl, Br, I). Twenty compositions, including single-, binary-, and ternary-halide systems, were synthesized via a mechanochemical route. Their ionic conductivities were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, while the local environments of Li and Al were investigated using solid-state NMR in combination with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD).  A conductivity map was constructed from the experimental data using a ternary diagram. The highest conductivity is observed near the center of the Cl-Br-I compositional triangle, where the configurational entropy is maximized. XRD patterns indicate that both binary and ternary mixed-halide samples retain the overall framework structure. 27Al magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR reveals multiple X combinations of AlX4- units in the binary and ternary systems, consistent with random anion mixing. 7Li MAS NMR spectra exhibit motional narrowing that correlates with enhanced ionic conductivity, particularly in the ternary compositions.  The activation energy and pre-exponential factor extracted from Arrhenius plots of the conductivity follow the Meyer-Neldel rule. These results suggest that the Li+ migration barrier can be overcome through the annihilation of multi-phonon excitation modes. The enhanced ionic conductivity achieved via increased compositional complexity highlights the potential of entropy-driven design strategies for next-generation solid-state batteries.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sxpz5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Coupled Cluster Free Energies for Atmospheric Molecular Clusters: Benchmark and Matching Experimental Free Energies</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0jz1q?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The initial formation of secondary aerosols, a large cause of uncertainty in modern radiative forcing modeling, can be simulated using quantum chemical methods. When based on quantum chemistry, the simulations have an exponential dependence on the free energy, requiring a high-accuracy description. In this study, we have computed harmonic frequencies and quasi-harmonic free energies for a set of 10 monomers and 29 dimers relevant for atmospheric molecular clusters at the DF-CCSD(F12b)(T*)/cc-pVDZ-F12 level of theory. The set is used to benchmark the M06-2X, PW91, ωB97X-D3BJ functions with the Jensen, Karlsruhe, and Pople style basis sets. The composite methods B97-3c, r2SCAN-3c, and ωB97X- 3c are also tested. We find ωB97X-D3BJ/ma-def2-SVP to be an optimal choice as it has low errors (mean absolute error of 0.13 kcal/mol) and few outliers in the thermal contribution. For calculations on larger clusters, B97-3c stands out. Using the ωB97X-D3BJ/ma-def2-SVP and B97-3c level of theories, we compute anharmonic frequencies using the VPT2 method and determine an anharmonic scaling factor of 0.961 and 0.953 for ωB97X-D3BJ/ma-def2-SVP and B97-3c frequencies, re- spectively. The scaling factor together with incorporating multi-conformer entropy ef- fects and a high-level single-point correction at the Nnormal LNO-CCSD(T)/CBS(aug- 3,aug-4) are used to compare to experimental determined free energies of the 11 hydrogen-bonded systems. We find that we obtain sub 1 kcal/mol errors when incor- porating the scaling factor, the multi-conformer entropy effects, and the single point correction.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0jz1q?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Exploring the Spectral Signatures of Large Amplitude Motions in the CH Stretching Region of the Vibrational Spectrum of CH5+</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-pw3b1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The spectra of CH5+ and its deuterated analogues are challenging to interpret due to the very flat potential surface and the highly delocalized ground state wave function.   In this work, an approach is developed to model the spectra of CH5+ and CH4D+.  In this approach, several thousand geometries are sampled from the ground-state probability amplitude, which is evaluated using diffusion Monte Carlo.  For each structure, the potential energy is minimized with respect to the five CH bond lengths, and the frequencies and intensities for the five 1-0 transitions involving the CH or CD stretching vibrations are then evaluated using a five-dimensional harmonically-coupled anharmonic oscillator model and a sum of one-dimensional cuts through the dipole moment surface. This information is used to obtain the spectrum by two approaches.  To model the lower-resolution laser-induced reaction spectrum, the calculated spectrum is obtained by convoluting the spectra obtained at all of the sampled structures.  To model the helium droplet spectrum, in which the individual CH transitions are resolved, the spectrum is obtained by averaging the Hamiltonian matrices and transition moment vectors over the sampled structures.  We find that these approaches reproduce reported spectra.  Analysis of the helium droplet spectrum leads us to conclude that in this environment the isomerization of CH5+ in its ground state is restricted compared to the gas-phase.  Overall, this approach provides a simple and physically transparent way to connect fluxional structures to CH-stretch spectral patterns, and offers frameworks for interpreting future spectroscopic studies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-pw3b1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] PervoTransformer: Transformer-Based PCE Prediction
and Device Design with MACE MLIPs for CsSnX3 Perovskites</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mdsdz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Perovskite solar cell performance depends on the joint configuration of materials, interfaces, and
layer-specific physical parameters, forming a structured design space that is naturally sequential but
rarely modeled as such. This work introduces PervoTransformer, a transformer-based framework that
represents complete device architectures as sequences and learns device-level behavior directly from
this representation. A RoBERTa model is finetuned on SCAPS-generated device sequences spanning
six perovskite families, including MAPbI3, FAPbI3, CsPbI3, and their Sn-based analogs. The model
predicts multiple performance metrics simultaneously, including power conversion efficiency (PCE),
short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc, and fill factor (FF), demonstrating that
transformer encoders can capture coupled, non-linear dependencies across the full device stack. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of transformer models to perovskite solar
cell device modeling using a sequence-based formulation. To explore device configurations beyond the
training distribution, a GPT-2 model is finetuned on the same device sequence formalism and used to
generate candidate architectures with novel combinations of compositional and physical parameters.
Generated sequences are screened for validity, uniqueness, and physical consistency using a retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) based constraint system. The validated devices are then passed back
through the finetuned RoBERTa model to predict performance metrics, enabling selection of high performing
candidates. Selected absorber configurations are further evaluated through device-level
simulations, forming an end-to-end loop for device prediction, generation, and screening. Additionally
machine-learned interatomic potentials based on the MACE framework are finetuned for CsSnX(X =
Cl,Br, I)3 using available DFT data, enabling efficient exploration of structural and energetic trends
in lead-free Sn perovskites and supporting absorber materials design. Together with the transformer based
predictive, generative, and screening workflow, this establishes a multi-scale strategy in which
sequence-aware transformers optimize device architectures while MLIPs guide atomic-scale materials
exploration for perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-mdsdz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Framework of Copolymer gel Dynamics and Ligand Interaction Factors, Objective-free exploration, and CVT-MAPElites</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4kmdq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Discovery-oriented research is a fundamental pursuit in chemical and materials science, especially when objective-free or purpose-ambiguous exploration can yield unexpected novel compounds or materials. Recently, data-driven objective-free exploration methods have emerged to support such discovery in materials science. However, these methods have mostly been limited to relatively simple systems (e.g., chemical composition), and extending them to real-world multiscale, multi-component materials like soft matter remains a critical challenge. In this study, we present a novel framework for objective-free exploration of a complex gel–ligand interaction system that integrates multiscale data. We embed monomer physicochemical information using four different large-language models (LLMs), and combine these embeddings with polymer dynamics descriptors obtained via time-domain NMR measurements. Using this combined representation, we perform novelty-driven search with BLOX (BoundLess Objective-free eXploration) and utilize CVT-MAP-Elites to map candidates in an interpretable behavioral characteristic space. Unlike conventional molecular descriptors, the LLM-based embedding supports a much broader and richer exploration of gel-ligand interaction space evaluated by 13C NMR signal intensities. The results demonstrate that our framework uncovers a wider diversity of candidate materials than descriptor-based approaches, thereby establishing a new pathway for discovery-oriented design of functional materials that integrates multiscale and multi-feature information.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4kmdq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] What if We Were to Design Transport in Aqueous Electrolytes Using Learnings from Lithium Battery Research?</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t8p83?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Electrolyte design has played a crucial role in the development of lithium batteries for a range of applications.

Abstract: Amorphous oxyhalides have attracted significant attention due to their relatively high ionic conductivity ($&gt;$1 mS cm$^{-1}$), excellent chemical stability, mechanical softness, and facile synthesis routes via standard solid-state reactions. These materials exhibit an ionic conductivity that is almost independent of the underlying chemistry, in stark contrast to what occurs in crystalline conductors. In this work, we employ an accurately fine-tuned machine learning interatomic potential to construct large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories encompassing hundreds of nanoseconds to obtain statistically converged transport properties. We find that the amorphous state consists of chain fragments of metal-anion tetrahedra of various lenght. By analyzing the residence time of alkali cations migrating around tetrahedrally-coordinated trivalent metal ions, we find that oxygen anions on the metal-anion tetrahedra limit alkali diffusion. By computing the full Einstein expression of the ionic conductivity, we demonstrate that the alkali transference number of these materials is strongly influenced by distinct-particles correlations, while at the same time they are characterized by an alkali Haven ratio close to one, implying that ionic transport is largely dictated by uncorrelated self-diffusion. Finally, by extending this analysis to chemical compositions $AMX_{2.5}\textsf{O}_{0.75}$, spanning different alkaline ($A$ = Li, Na, K), metallic ($M$ = Al, Ga, In), and halogen ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) species, we clarify why the diffusion properties of these materials remain largely insensitive to variations in atomic chemistry.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06384v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond Predicted ZT: Machine Learning Strategies for the Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06571</link><description>arXiv:2601.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric (TE) materials for advancing green energy harvesting from waste heat is an urgent need in the context of looming energy crisis and climate change. The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has accelerated the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, yet a persistent "gap" remains between high-accuracy computational predictions and their successful experimental validation. While ML models frequently report impressive test scores (R^2 values of 0.90-0.98) for complex TE properties (zT, power factor, and electrical/thermal conductivity), only a handful of these predictions have culminated in the experimental discovery of new high-zT materials. In this review, we identify and discuss that the primary obstacles are poor model generalizability-stemming from the "small-data" problem, sampling biases in cross-validation, and inadequate structural representation-alongside the critical challenge of thermodynamic phase stability. Moreover, we argue that standard randomized validation often overestimates model performance by ignoring "hidden hierarchies" and clustering within chemical families. Finally, to bridge this gap between ML-predictions and experimental realization, we advocate for advanced validation strategies like PCA-based sampling and a synergetic active learning loop that integrates ML "fast filters" for stability (e.g., GNoME) with high-throughput combinatorial thin-film synthesis to rapidly map stable, high-zT compositional spaces.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06571v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Altermagnetism-driven FFLO superconductivity in finite-filling 2D lattices</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06735</link><description>arXiv:2601.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the emergence of finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity in a square lattice Hubbard model with finite filling, driven by either $d_{xy}$-wave or $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetic order in the presence of on-site $s$-wave attractive interactions. Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity. These findings may provide guidance for experimental exploration of altermagnetism-induced FFLO states in real materials with more complex electronic structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06735v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Bgolearn: a Unified Bayesian Optimization Framework for Accelerating Materials Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06820</link><description>arXiv:2601.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient exploration of vast compositional and processing spaces is essential for accelerated materials discovery. Bayesian optimization (BO) provides a principled strategy for identifying optimal materials with minimal experiments, yet its adoption in materials science is hindered by implementation complexity and limited domain-specific tools. Here, we present Bgolearn, a comprehensive Python framework that makes BO accessible and practical for materials research through an intuitive interface, robust algorithms, and materials-oriented workflows. Bgolearn supports both single-objective and multi-objective Bayesian optimization with multiple acquisition functions (e.g., expected improvement, upper confidence bound, probability of improvement, and expected hypervolume improvement etc.), diverse surrogate models (including Gaussian processes, random forests, and gradient boosting etc.), and bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. Benchmark studies show that Bgolearn reduces the number of required experiments by 40-60% compared with random search, grid search, and genetic algorithms, while maintaining comparable or superior solution quality. Its effectiveness is demonstrated not only through the studies presented in this paper, such as the identification of maximum-elastic-modulus triply periodic minimal surface structures, ultra-high-hardness high-entropy alloys, and high-strength, high-ductility medium-Mn steels, but also by numerous publications that have proven its impact in material discovery. With a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly into existing materials workflows and a graphical user interface (BgoFace) that removes programming barriers, Bgolearn establishes a practical and reliable platform for Bayesian optimization in materials science, and is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06820v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Nanoindentation induced plasticity in equiatomic MoTaW alloys by experimentally guided machine learning molecular dynamics simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06846</link><description>arXiv:2601.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCA) exhibit exceptional strength and thermal stability, yet their plastic deformation mechanisms under complex contact loading remain insufficiently understood. Here, the nanoindentation response of an equiatomic MoTaW alloy is investigated through a combined experimental and atomistically resolved modeling approach. Spherical nanoindentation experiments are coupled with large scale molecular dynamics simulations employing a tabulated low dimensional Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), enabling near DFT accuracy. A physics based similarity criterion, implemented via PCA of load-displacement curves, is used to identify mechanically representative experimental responses for quantitative comparison with simulations. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed yielding excellent agreement in the elastic regime between experiment and simulation, with reduced Young's moduli of approximately 270 GPa. Generalized stacking fault energy calculations reveal elevated unstable stacking- and twinning-fault energies in MoTaW relative to pure refractory elements, indicating suppressed localized shear and a preference for dislocation-mediated plasticity. Atomistic analyses demonstrate a strong crystallographic dependence of plastic deformation, with symmetric {110}&lt;111&gt; slip activation and four-fold rosette pile-ups for the [001] orientation, and anisotropic slip, strain localization, and enhanced junction formation for [011]. Local entropy and polyhedral template matching analyses further elucidate dislocation network evolution and deformation-induced local structural transformations. Overall, this study establishes a direct mechanistic link between fault energetics, orientation-dependent dislocation activity, and experimentally observed nanoindentation behavior in RCCA.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06846v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A survey of active learning in materials science: Data-driven paradigm for accelerating the research pipeline</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06971</link><description>arXiv:2601.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of materials composition, structure, and processing spaces is constrained by high dimensionality and the cost of data acquisition. While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.
  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.
  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06971v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Case study of an exploratory high voltage NASICON-based Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ cathode material for sodium-ion batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07012</link><description>arXiv:2601.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a new NASICON-type Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ material designed for high-voltage and multi-electron reactions for the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, using the R$\bar{3}$c space group, confirmed the stabilization of the rhombohedral NASICON framework. Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07012v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Observation of Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in the Type-I Superconductor YbSb$_2$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07460</link><description>arXiv:2601.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry is a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity, typically observed in type-II superconductors. Here, we report evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the type-I superconductor YbSb$_2$. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal spontaneous internal magnetic fields emerging just below the superconducting transition, while transverse-field $\mu$SR confirms a fully gapped type-I superconducting state. Our first-principles calculations identify YbSb$_2$ as a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ topological metal hosting a Dirac nodal line near the Fermi level. Symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg Landau framework indicates an internally antisymmetric nonunitary triplet (INT) state as the most probable superconducting ground state. Calculations based on an effective low-energy model further demonstrate that this INT state hosts gapless Majorana surface modes, establishing YbSb$_2$ as a topological superconductor. Our results highlight YbSb$_2$ as a unique material platform where type-I superconductivity coexists with triplet-pairing and nontrivial topology.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07460v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning nonequilibrium phase transitions in charge-density wave insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07583</link><description>arXiv:2601.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07583v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] PFT: Phonon Fine-tuning for Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07742</link><description>arXiv:2601.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of materials by matching MLIP energy Hessians to DFT-computed force constants from finite displacement phonon calculations. To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07742v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum algorithm for dephasing of coupled systems: decoupling and IQP duality</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06298</link><description>arXiv:2601.06298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise and decoherence are ubiquitous in the dynamics of quantum systems coupled to an external environment. In the regime where environmental correlations decay rapidly, the evolution of a subsytem is well described by a Lindblad quantum master equation. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm for simulating unital Lindbladian dynamics by sampling unitary quantum channels without extra ancillas. Using ancillary qubits we show that this algorithm allows approximating general Lindbladians as well. For interacting dephasing Lindbladians coupling two subsystems, we develop a decoupling scheme that reduces the circuit complexity of the simulation. This is achieved by sampling from a time-correlated probability distribution - determined by the evolution of one subsystem, which specifies the stochastic circuit implemented on the complementary subsystem. We demonstrate our approach by studying a model of bosons coupled to fermions via dephasing, which naturally arises from anharmonic effects in an electron-phonon system coupled to a bath. Our method enables tracing out the bosonic degrees of freedom, reducing part of the dynamics to sampling an instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuit. The sampled bitstrings then define a corresponding fermionic problem, which in the non-interacting case can be solved efficiently classically.

These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems. Across all cases, the method converges with high fidelity and evaluation efficiency while preserving physical constraints. Overall, our work establishes physics-informed tree search as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for computational design and high-dimensional scientific optimization, bridging discrete decision-making frameworks with continuous search in scientific design workflows.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06444v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Cation Dominated but Negatively Charged Na2SO4,aq-Graphene Interfaces</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06995</link><description>arXiv:2601.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 ${\AA}$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06995v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] The Impact of Ionic Anharmonicity on Superconductivity in Metal-Stuffed B-C Clathrates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12068</link><description>arXiv:2501.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-stuffed B$-$C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured increasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the quantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete understanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art ab initio methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials, we revisit the properties of a series of $XY$$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ clathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum and anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes, enabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable in the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported ($XY$)$^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high critical temperatures. Further calculations based on the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equation demonstrate that the $T_\text{c}$ values for KRb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ and Rb$\text{B}_{3}\text{C}_{3}$ among these stabilized compounds are 102 and 115 K at 0 and 15 GPa, respectively, both being higher than $T_\text{c}$ of 92 K of KPb$\text{B}_{6}\text{C}_{6}$ at the anharmonic level. These record-high $T_\text{c}$ values, surpassing liquid nitrogen temperatures, emphasize the importance of anharmonic effects in stabilizing B-C clathrates with large electron-phonon coupling strength and advancing the search for high-$T_\text{c}$ superconductivity at (near) ambient pressure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.12068v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Microscopic theory of phonon polaritons and long wavelength dielectric response</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03915</link><description>arXiv:2505.03915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles approach for calculating phonon-polariton dispersion relations. In this approach, phonon-photon interaction is described by quantization of a Hamiltonian that describes harmonic lattice vibrations coupled with the electromagnetic field inside the material. All Hamiltonian parameters are obtained from first-principles calculations, with diagonalization leading to non-interacting polariton quasiparticles. This method naturally includes retardation effects and resolves non-analytical behavior and ambiguities in phonon frequencies at the Brillouin zone center, especially in non-cubic and optically anisotropic materials. Furthermore, by incorporating higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian, we also account for quasiparticle interactions and spectral broadening. Specifically, we show how anharmonic effects in phonon polaritons lead to a dielectric response that challenges traditional models. The accuracy and consequences of the approach are demonstrated on GaP and GaN as harmonic test systems and PbTe and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ as anharmonic test systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.03915v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05339</link><description>arXiv:2510.05339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.05339v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. This study investigates ion-exchange kinetics within silicate glasses, operating under the Nernst-Planck binary interdiffusion regime. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v3</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Dielectric Tensor Predictions for Inorganic Materials using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04755</link><description>arXiv:2601.04755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dielectric tensors is essential for accelerating the discovery of next-generation inorganic dielectric materials. Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database. GoeCTP successfully identifies various promising candidates, such as Zr(InBr$_3$)$_2$ (band gap $E_g = 2.41$ eV, dielectric constant $\overline{\varepsilon} = 194.72$) and SeI$_2$ (anisotropy ratio $\alpha_r = 96.763$), demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in accelerating the discovery of advanced inorganic dielectric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04755v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link><description>arXiv:2411.02740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.02740v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition in a context-sensitive random language model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01212</link><description>arXiv:2412.01212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades. The recent rise of large language models has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities. However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking. In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics, we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context-sensitive grammars, which we call the context-sensitive random language model, and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model. We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly zero to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider. Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase. This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but are generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.01212v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Refractive Index, Its Chromatic Dispersion, and Thermal Coefficients of Four Less Common Glycols</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11819</link><description>arXiv:2504.11819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report comprehensive measurements of the refractive index as a function of wavelength and temperature for four less commonly studied glycols: pentaethylene glycol, hexaethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol (mixture of isomers), and tripropylene glycol. The measurements cover the spectral range of 0.39-1.07 ${\mu}$m and temperatures from 1${\deg}$C to 45${\deg}$C. The data were modeled using a two-pole Sellmeier equation, with temperature dependence expressed through wavelength-dependent thermal coefficients. Four fitting models (Sellmeier and Cauchy) with different numbers of parameters were tested. For pentaethylene glycol, results from all models are shown; for the remaining glycols, only the two-pole Sellmeier fits are presented in tabular form. Thermal coefficient values for six wavelengths of practical importance are also tabulated. Experimental uncertainties in refractive index, wavelength, and temperature were rigorously evaluated and incorporated into the analysis. The influence of sample purity, including residual water content and manufacturer-reported impurities, was assessed and accounted for in the uncertainty estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset to systematically characterize both chromatic dispersion and thermal variation of the refractive index for these glycols over such a broad spectral and temperature range. The validated fitting equations and parameters are suitable for use in optical modeling, materials characterisation, and related applications. All raw data are available in a publicly accessible repository.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.11819v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] TBPLaS 2.0: a Tight-Binding Package for Large-scale Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26309</link><description>arXiv:2509.26309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common exact diagonalization-based techniques to solving tight-binding models suffer from O(N^2) and O(N^3) scaling with respect to model size in memory and CPU time, hindering their applications in large tight-binding models. On the contrary, the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM) can achieve linear scaling in both memory and CPU time, and is capable of handling large tight-binding models with billions of orbitals. In this paper, we introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation based on TBPM. This new version brings significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++ implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order of magnitude. The workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and Chern number calculation, partial diagonalization for specific eigenvalues and eigenstates, analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features. Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26309v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Symbolic regression for defect interactions in 2D materials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20785</link><description>arXiv:2512.20785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.20785v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231</link><description>arXiv:2512.21231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21231v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04407</link><description>arXiv:2601.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04407v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A data-efficient reactive machine learning potential to accelerate automated exploration of complex reaction networks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-sm7f3-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Reactive machine learning potentials (MLPs) significantly benefits high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks.

The MDCD-NN MLP trained on MDCD20 surpasses existing available MLPs trained on much larger datasets in reconstructing 181 elementary reactions with widespread types. It also accelerates automatic reaction network exploration by 10^4-fold in real-world systems relative to its reference quantum chemistry (QM) calculations, tackling complex scenarios such as multiple reaction centers, enantioselectivity and dynamic free-energy landscapes that are beyond the reach of traditional QM methods.

Here, we evaluate this heuristic on an experimental database of magnetic structures. We observe that the heuristic is largely satisfied, and we discuss the exceptions. We then demonstrate how integrating this heuristic into machine learning models for predicting magnetic ordering enhances prediction quality. Notably, these magnetism models are also capable of predicting if non-collinear magnetic ordering might occur.

Their reliability, however, is often limited by approximations in intramolecular interactions and solvation effects. Given the critical role of force field quality in determining accuracy, we developed a hybrid framework named AIQM-PBSA, which integrates the ONIOM scheme with the PBSA model. Within this framework, the AIQM3 machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) —an advanced Δ-learning quantum mechanical (QM) model—is employed to refine the molecular mechanics (MM) energy term, while polar and non polar solvation contributions are evaluated under the PBSA formalism. Extensive validation across diverse protein–ligand systems demonstrates that AIQM-PBSA significantly improves the correlation with experimental binding affinities compared to MMPBSA based on classical force fields and other MLIPs, with a representative benchmark showing up to 31% higher Pearson correlation relative to the MMPBSA baseline and 16% higher than ANI-2x. Furthermore, incorporating entropic contributions can further provide modest, target-dependent improvements. In summary, AIQM-PBSA offers a robust and transferable framework that combines QM level accuracy with MM level efficiency, substantially enhancing the reliability of endpoint free energy calculations for biomolecular recognition.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-h0kn1?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] To Be or Not to Be: The Elusive Nature of Wheland-type Intermediates in Zeolite-Catalyzed Aromatic Alkylation Revealed by CCSD(T)-quality Metadynamics</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-2krfd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The sustainable utilization of biomass feedstocks to produce value-added chemicals is a central challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Cyclic alcohols constitute a major fraction of biomass-derived compounds, and their catalytic upgrading via zeolite-catalyzed alkylation provides an efficient route toward fuels and fine chemicals. In particular, benzene alkylation enables the synthesis of industrially relevant alkylated aromatics, while phenol alkylation is crucial for the valorization of lignin-derived feedstocks. Here, we employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) combined with well-tempered Metadynamics (WTMetaD) to investigate the alkylation of benzene and phenol using cyclohexene---the dehydrated form of cyclohexanol---as the alkylating agent within a zeolite framework. Free-energy surfaces (FES) obtained from enhanced sampling simulations are refined beyond standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT) using free-energy perturbation (FEP) to achieve MP2 and CCSD(T) accuracy. Our results reveal that it is essential to move beyond standard GGA-based DFT to accurately assess the stability of charged intermediates. The arenium ion (or Wheland intermediate), a key $\sigma$-complex in electrophilic aromatic substitution, appears relatively stable at the GGA level of theory.  However, higher-level CCSD(T) calculations show that it corresponds to only a weakly stabilized, shallow minimum, indicating a highly transient character. The presence of an activating group such as the hydroxyl substituent in phenol significantly stabilizes both the arenium intermediate and the corresponding transition state, thereby lowering the overall alkylation activation barrier.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-2krfd?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Chemistry: A Comprehensive Survey</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dtw9b?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heralded a new era in artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in understanding, generating, and reasoning with human language. Their potential to revolutionize scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry, is immense. However, standalone LLMs are inherently limited by their reliance on static pre-training data, leading to issues such as factual hallucination, outdated knowledge, and a lack of transparency in their reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to mitigate these limitations by grounding LLM responses in external, up-to-date, and verifiable knowledge sources. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the intersection of RAG and LLMs within the chemical sciences. We delve into the foundational concepts of LLMs and RAG, detail the unique architectures and methodologies required for handling diverse chemical data, and systematically review their applications across drug discovery, materials science, reaction prediction, and chemical literature mining. Furthermore, we critically examine the existing challenges, limitations, and ethical considerations inherent in deploying RAG-LLMs in chemistry. Finally, we discuss promising future directions, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation benchmarks and advanced multimodal RAG systems to unlock the full potential of these transformative technologies in accelerating chemical innovation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-dtw9b?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Construction of Arbitrary Order Internal Coordinate Transformations to Improve Studies of Large Amplitude Motions</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bzmpw?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Internal coordinates and their derivatives underpin the efficient treatment of geometry optimizations, high-resolution spectroscopic simulation, and the fitting of potential surfaces in quantum chemistry. Existing descriptions of the construction of internal coordinate derivatives generally either lack simplicity or generality. In this paper, we provide a simple framework for evaluating any internal coordinate derivative to any order and an automatic approach to obtain the corresponding inverse transformation. Through further extension to transformations between internal coordinate systems, this approach provides a complete, generic method for handling a wide variety of molecular problems. The utility of this construction is demonstrated by investigations into the behavior of internal coordinate interpolations for studying isomerizations, quantifying the coupling between carbonyl stretches and a complex stretch coordinate in an organometallic system, and analysis of the performance of a machine learned interatomic potential in computing anharmonic frequencies as a function of low-frequency coordinate distortions. This approach is shown to be numerically efficient as well as general, and a reference implementation is provided.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bzmpw?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

However, precise morphological control within bulk-heterojunction active layers remains a crucial barrier to commercial viability, primarily due to the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex interdependencies among processing variables. To overcome this challenge, we established a standardized materials-processing-performance database integrating donor/acceptor pairs, nine key active layer processing parameters, and device efficiencies. This database, curated from over a decade of experimental results, resolves critical data heterogeneity issues and provides the field's most comprehensive optimization resource. Leveraging this resource, we developed a novel three-tiered machine learning framework employing gradient boosting regression trees to progressively decode active layer processing complexities. Our strategy initiates with single-parameter models for targeted optimization, advances through stage-combined models revealing intra-process synergies (e.g., solvent-additive interplay), and culminates in a global optimization tier. Remarkably, this final tier achieves unprecedented performance, demonstrating &gt;0.9 overall Pearson correlations, and &gt;80% success rates in identifying optimal nine-dimensional configurations. Experimental validation on 78 novel systems confirms exceptional generalization, yielding &gt;75% accuracy in predicting either optimal or secondary parameters across eight active layer processing conditions. This work establishes a robust framework for navigating processing complexity in high-dimensional spaces, enabling accelerated optimization of OPV photoactive layers and providing a transferable data-driven paradigm for rational process design in emerging photovoltaic technologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bhjz6-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: Plastic deformation and fracture of FCC metals involve the formation of stable or unstable stacking faults (SFs) on (111) plane. Examples include dislocation cross-slip and dislocation nucleation at interfaces and near crack tips. The stress component normal to (111) plane can strongly affect the SF energy when the stress magnitude reaches several to tens of GPa. We conduct a series of DFT calculations of SF energies in six FCC metals: Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. The results show that normal compression significantly increases the stable and unstable SF energies in all six metals, while normal tension decreases them. The SF formation is accompanied by inelastic expansion in the normal direction. The DFT calculations are compared with predictions of several representative classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials. Many potentials fail to capture the correct stress effect on the SF energy, often predicting trends opposite to the DFT calculations. Possible ways to improve the ability of potentials to represent the stress effect on SF energy are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05453v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Discovery of the Ising Model's Critical Parameters with Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05577</link><description>arXiv:2601.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for determining critical parameters are often influenced by human factors. This research introduces a physics-inspired adaptive reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to autonomously interact with physical environments, simultaneously identifying both the critical temperature and various types of critical exponents in the Ising model with precision. Interestingly, our algorithm exhibits search behavior reminiscent of phase transitions, efficiently converging to target parameters regardless of initial conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms traditional approaches, particularly in environments with strong perturbations. This study not only incorporates physical concepts into machine learning to enhance algorithm interpretability but also establishes a new paradigm for scientific exploration, transitioning from manual analysis to autonomous AI discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05577v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Phase Frustration Induced Intrinsic Bose Glass in the Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard Model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05781</link><description>arXiv:2601.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an intrinsic "Bubble Phase" in the two-dimensional Kitaev-Bose-Hubbard model, driven purely by phase frustration between complex hopping and anisotropic pairing. By combining Inhomogeneous Gutzwiller Mean-Field Theory with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis augmented by a novel Energy Penalty Method, we demonstrate that this phase spontaneously fragments into coherent islands, exhibiting the hallmark Bose glass signature of finite compressibility without global superfluidity. Notably, we propose a unified framework linking disorder-driven localization to deterministic phase frustration, identifying the Bubble Phase as a pristine, disorder-free archetype of the Bose glass. Our results provide a theoretical blueprint for realizing glassy dynamics in clean quantum simulators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05781v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Critical Examination of Active Learning Workflows in Materials Science</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05946</link><description>arXiv:2601.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) plays a critical role in materials science, enabling applications such as the construction of machine-learning interatomic potentials for atomistic simulations and the operation of self-driving laboratories. Despite its widespread use, the reliability and effectiveness of AL workflows depend on implicit design assumptions that are rarely examined systematically. Here, we critically assess AL workflows deployed in materials science and investigate how key design choices, such as surrogate models, sampling strategies, uncertainty quantification and evaluation metrics, relate to their performance. By identifying common pitfalls and discussing practical mitigation strategies, we provide guidance to practitioners for the efficient design, assessment, and interpretation of AL workflows in materials science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05946v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Autonomous Sampling and SHAP Interpretation of Deposition-Rates in Bipolar HiPIMS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05287</link><description>arXiv:2601.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05287v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] VacHopPy: A Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23467</link><description>arXiv:2503.23467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale modeling, which integrates material properties from ab initio calculations into continuum-scale simulations, is a promising strategy for optimizing semiconductor devices. However, a key challenge remains: while ab initio methods provide diffusion parameters specific to individual migration paths, continuum equations require a single effective set of parameters that captures the overall diffusion behavior. To address this issue, we present VacHopPy, an open-source Python package for vacancy hopping analysis based on molecular dynamics (MD). VacHopPy extracts an effective set of hopping parameters, including hopping distance, hopping barrier, number of effective paths, correlation factor, and attempt frequency, by statistically integrating energetic, kinetic, and geometric contributions across all paths. It also includes tools for tracking vacancy trajectories and for detecting phase transitions during MD simulations. The applicability of VacHopPy is demonstrated in three representative materials: face-centered cubic Al, rutile TiO2, and monoclinic HfO2. The extracted effective parameters reproduce temperature-dependent diffusion behavior and are in good agreement with previous experimental data. Provided in a simplified form, these parameters are well suited for continuum-scale models and remain valid over a wide temperature range spanning several hundred kelvins. Furthermore, VacHopPy inherently accounts for anisotropy in thermal vibrations, a factor often overlooked, making it suitable for simulating diffusion in complex crystals. Overall, VacHopPy establishes a robust bridge between atomic- and continuum-scale models, enabling more reliable multiscale simulation</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.23467v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning Framework for Characterizing Processing-Structure Relationship in Block Copolymer Thin Films</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23064</link><description>arXiv:2505.23064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The morphology of block copolymers (BCPs) critically influences material properties and applications. This work introduces a machine learning (ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing accuracy. Classified images were then analyzed to extract 2D grain size measurements from the samples in a high-throughput manner. ML models were developed to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such as solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties were predicted with strong performances ($R^2$ &gt; 0.75), while AFM-based property predictions were less accurate ($R^2$ &lt; 0.60), likely due to the localized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured by GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive ratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive provides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into thermodynamically favorable morphologies. This interpretability helps validate model predictions and offers insight into parameter importance. Altogether, the presented framework combining high-throughput characterization and interpretable ML offers an approach to exploring and optimizing BCP thin film morphology across a broad processing landscape.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.23064v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Band Structure Unfolding with Atom-centered Orbitals: General Theory and Application</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21089</link><description>arXiv:2506.21089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Band structure unfolding is a key technique for analyzing and simplifying the electronic band structure of large, internally distorted supercells that break the primitive cell's translational symmetry. In this work, we present an efficient band unfolding method for atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that explicitly accounts for both the non-orthogonality of atomic orbitals and their atom-centered nature. Unlike existing approaches that typically rely on a plane-wave representation of the (semi-)valence states, we here derive analytical expressions that recasts the primitive cell translational operator and the associated Bloch-functions in the supercell AO basis. In turn, this enables the accurate and efficient unfolding of conduction, valence, and core states in all-electron codes, as demonstrated by our implementation in the all-electron ab initio simulation package FHI-aims, which employs numeric atom-centered orbitals. We explicitly demonstrate the capability of running large-scale unfolding calculations for systems with thousands of atoms and showcase the importance of this technique for computing temperature-dependent spectral functions in strongly anharmonic materials using CuI as example.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.21089v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link><description>arXiv:2601.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01010v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning for in-situ composition mapping in a self-driving magnetron sputtering system</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05999</link><description>arXiv:2506.05999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks, obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10 experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials exploration.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.05999v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] ACCEL: Automated Closed-loop Co-Optimization and Experimentation Learning Enables Phase-Pure Identification in Formamidinium-based Dion–Jacobson Halide Perovskites</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8c93m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are poised to transform materials discovery by integrating automation with machine learning (ML) to accelerate data-driven experimentation. However, most SDL frameworks remain limited by single-feedback optimization and lack the multi-modal diagnostics needed to resolve both optical and structural evolution in complex hybrid systems. Here, we introduce ACCEL, an automated, ML-guided closed-loop platform for identifying and synthesizing target pure phases within quasi-2D halide perovskite systems. Using a ternary 3D:2D compositional space comprising 3D FAPbI3 and two Dion–Jacobson (DJ) spacer–based components, ACCEL optimizes the 3D:2D ratios to identify compositions that converge toward a structurally and optically stable α-FAPbI3-like phase within a quasi-2D design space. Automated in-situ photoluminescence (PL) is used to monitor crystallization kinetics in real time, revealing how the relative fraction of co-spacers governs nucleation rate and phase evolution during film formation. These kinetic insights are integrated with high-throughput synthesis, automated PL analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) similarity metrics within a Gaussian Process–Bayesian Optimization framework to suppress phase heterogeneity and stabilize the target phase. Rather than targeting a predefined DJ layer number, ACCEL enables optimization based on user-defined optical and structural signatures, providing a generalizable route for autonomous phase discovery in complex hybrid materials.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8c93m?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

chemical tasks. The best existing methods focus on building base models that combine molecular graphs (“2D structures”) with atomic coordinates in 3D to predict molecular properties, typically through pre-training followed by fine-tuning on benchmark datasets. However, current approaches require updating the weights of the entire model during the fine-tuning procedure for each prediction task. While this enables state-of-the-art performance, it limits practical deployment, as real-world datasets are often too small to support the stable retraining of large models. Importantly, the 3D geometry of a molecule holds crucial information for predicting its properties, but a single molecular graph usually corresponds to several 3D geometries, called conformers, introducing ambiguity into the inference process. Typical solutions rely on molecular graphs, but this approach is not easily generalizable beyond organic molecules. Here, we present ConforFormer, a method that explicitly accounts for the diversity of 3D conformations of a molecule to derive a task-agnostic and conformation-agnostic vector representation. This model serves as a foundational framework, producing embeddings that can be generated once and directly applied to downstream tasks, including property prediction and structural similarity, without extensive fine-tuning.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-x68vd-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Graph learning of sequence statistics for polymer representation</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tb0td?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Polymers underpin critical technologies from medicine to energy, but their immense chemical and structural diversity makes rational design exceptionally difficult. Machine learning offers a way to navigate this space, yet prevailing approaches inherit small-molecule representations that fail to encode polymer-specific architecture; the distinction between random, block and other statistical copolymers is often collapsed into a categorical tag or ignored. Here, we introduce SCALE (Statistical Copolymer Architecture with Learning Edges), which recasts a copolymer as a Markovian sequence over a monomer alphabet and embeds the transition probabilities P(j/i) as edge features within a graph attention network. Message passing thus computes contextualized monomer states analogous to applying a transfer operator along the chain, while attention learns a data-driven kernel over paths that weights sequence heterogeneity versus block persistence. On a robotically synthesized, high-throughput fluorescence library, SCALE attained RMSE ≈228 and R² ≈0.84, surpassing polymer-adapted neural baselines and descriptor regressors (e.g., wDMPNN RMSE ≈326; XGBoost RMSE ≈254). The model is interpretable: edges dominate predictions for statistical (random) copolymers, whereas nodes prevail for block copolymers, consistent with NOESY 2D NMR. Beyond photophysics, SCALE generalized to antibacterial design across penta- and hexa-copolymer libraries with validation from &lt;300 syntheses. By elevating sequence statistics to first-class learning variables, SCALE provides a generalizable, data-efficient route to closed-loop polymer discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tb0td?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[npj Computational Materials] Machine learning for phase prediction of high entropy carbide ceramics from imbalanced data</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01873-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;npj Computational Materials, Published online: 10 January 2026;

Abstract: We consider the intrinsic fluctuation conductivity in metals with multiply sheeted Fermi surfaces approaching a superconducting critical point. Restricting our attention to extreme type-II multicomponent superconductors motivates focusing on the ultraclean limit. Using functional-integral techniques, we derive the Gaussian fluctuation action from which we obtain the gauge-invariant electromagnetic linear response kernel. This allows us to compute the optical conductivity tensor. We identify essential conditions required for a nonzero longitudinal conductivity at finite frequencies in a disorder-free and translationally invariant system. Specifically, this is neither related to impurity scattering nor electron-phonon interaction, but derives indirectly from the multicomponent character of the incipient superconducting order and the parent metallic state. Under these conditions, the enhancement of the DC conductivity due to fluctuations close to the critical point follows the same critical behaviour as in the diffusive limit.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04308v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Towards understanding the defect properties in the multivalent A-site Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$-based perovskite ceramics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04725</link><description>arXiv:2601.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A defect model involving cation and anion vacancies and anti-site defects is proposed that accounts for the non-stoichiometry of multi-valent $A$-site Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ based perovskite oxides with $ABO_3$ composition. A series of samples with varying $A$-site non-stoichiometry and $A$:$B$ ratios were prepared to investigate their electrical conductivity. The oxygen partial pressure and temperature dependent conductivities where studied with direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) techniques, enabling to separate between ionic and electronic conduction. The Na-excess samples, regardless of the $A$:$B$ ratio, exhibit dominant ionic conductivity and $p$-type electronic conduction, with the highest total conductivity reaching $4 \times 10^{-4}$ S/cm at 450$^\circ$C. In contrast, the Bi-excess samples display more insulating characteristics and $n$-type electronic conductivity, with conductivity values within the 10$^{-8}$ S/cm range at 450$^\circ$C. These conductivity results strongly support the proposed defect model, which offers a straightforward description of defect chemistry in NBT-based ceramics and serves as a valuable guide for optimizing sample processing to achieve tailored properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04725v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Scalable Dielectric Tensor Predictions for Inorganic Materials using Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04755</link><description>arXiv:2601.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of dielectric tensors is essential for accelerating the discovery of next-generation inorganic dielectric materials. Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database. GoeCTP successfully identifies various promising candidates, such as Zr(InBr$_3$)$_2$ (band gap $E_g = 2.41$ eV, dielectric constant $\overline{\varepsilon} = 194.72$) and SeI$_2$ (anisotropy ratio $\alpha_r = 96.763$), demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in accelerating the discovery of advanced inorganic dielectric materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04755v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Lateral Graphene-Metallene Interfaces at the Nanoscale</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04838</link><description>arXiv:2601.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallenes are atomically thin, nonlayered two-dimensional materials. While they have appealing properties, their isotropic metallic bonding makes their stabilization difficult and presents considerable challenges to their synthesis and practical applications. However, their stabilization can still be achieved by suspending them in the pores of two-dimensional template materials, making the properties of lateral interfaces of metallenes scientifically relevant. Here, we combined density-functional theory and universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to study lateral interfaces between graphene and 45 metallenes with various profiles. We optimized the interfaces and analyzed their energies, electronic structures, and stabilities at room temperature, defect formations, and structural deformations. While broad trends were identified using machine-learning analysis of all interfaces, density-functional theory was the main tool for studying the microscopic properties of selected elements. We found that the interfaces are the most stable energetically and with respect to lattice mismatch, defect formation, and lateral strain when their profiles were geometrically smooth. The most stable interfaces are found for transition metals. In addition, we demonstrate how universal machine-learning interatomic potentials now offer the accuracy required for the modeling of graphene-metallene interfaces. By systematically expanding the understanding of metallenes' interface properties, we hope these results guide and accelerate their synthesis to enable future applications and benefit from metallenes' appealing properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04838v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Stable Machine Learning Potentials for Liquid Metals via Dataset Engineering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05003</link><description>arXiv:2601.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid metals are central to energy-storage and nuclear technologies, yet quantitative knowledge of their thermophysical properties remains limited. While atomistic simulations offer a route to computing liquid properties directly from atomic motion, the most accurate approach, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), is computationally costly and restricted to short time and length scales. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) offer AIMD accuracy at far lower cost, but their application to liquids is limited by training datasets that inadequately sample atomic configurations, leading to unphysical force predictions and unstable trajectories. Here we introduce a physically motivated dataset-engineering strategy that constructs liquidlike training data synthetically rather than relying on AIMD configurations. The method exploits the established icosahedral short-range order of metallic liquids, twelvefold, near-close-packed local coordination, and generates "synthetic-liquid" structures by systematic perturbation of crystalline references. MLPs trained on these datasets close the sampling gaps that lead to unphysical predictions, remain numerically stable across temperatures, and reproduce experimental liquid densities, diffusivities, and melting temperatures for multiple elemental metals. The framework links atomic-scale sampling to long-term MD stability and provides a practical route to predictive modeling of liquid-phase thermophysical behavior beyond the limits of direct AIMD.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05003v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Hierarchical Crystal Structure Prediction of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks Using DFT and Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05097</link><description>arXiv:2601.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is emerging as a powerful method for the computational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this article we demonstrate the high-throughput exploration of the crystal energy landscape of zinc imidazolate (ZnIm2), a highly polymorphic member of the zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF) family, with at least 24 reported structural and topological forms, with new polymorphs still being regularly discovered. With the aid of custom-trained machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) we have performed a high-throughput sampling of over 3 million randomly-generated crystal packing arrangements and identified 9626 energy minima characterized by 1493 network topologies, including 864 topologies that have not been reported before. Comparisons with previously reported structures revealed 13 topological matches to the experimentally-observed structures of ZnIm2, demonstrating the power of the CSP method in sampling experimentally-relevant ZIF structures. Finally, through a combination of topological analysis, density and porosity considerations, we have identified a set of structures representing promising targets for future experimental screening. Finally, we demonstrate how CSP can be used to assist in the identification of the products of the mechanochemical synthesis.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05097v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Beyond the imbalance: site-resolved dynamics probing resonances in many-body localization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05177</link><description>arXiv:2601.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05177v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Chiral Graviton Modes in Fermionic Fractional Chern Insulators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05196</link><description>arXiv:2601.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05196v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Exact Multimode Quantization of Superconducting Circuits via Boundary Admittance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04407</link><description>arXiv:2601.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(\omega_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $\alpha$, and dispersive shift $\chi$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Higher-Order Knowledge Representations for Agentic Scientific Reasoning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04878</link><description>arXiv:2601.04878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific inquiry requires systems-level reasoning that integrates heterogeneous experimental data, cross-domain knowledge, and mechanistic evidence into coherent explanations. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a "teacherless" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04878v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A joint voxel flow - phase field framework for ultra-long microstructure evolution prediction with physical regularization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04898</link><description>arXiv:2601.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field (PF) modeling is a powerful tool for simulating microstructure evolution. To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%. This joint framework enables rapid, generalized, flexible and physically consistent microstructure forecasting from image-based data for ultra-long time scales.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04898v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Robust Reasoning as a Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05240</link><description>arXiv:2601.05240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models suffer from "hallucinations"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a "Metric Phase," where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braiding, replacing fragile geometric interpolation with robust topological invariants. Empirically, we demonstrate a sharp topological phase transition: while Transformers and RNNs exhibit gapless decay, our Holonomic Network reveals a macroscopic "mass gap," maintaining invariant fidelity below a critical noise threshold. Furthermore, in a variable-binding task on $S_{10}$ ($3.6 \times 10^6$ states) representing symbolic manipulation, we demonstrate holonomic generalization: the topological model maintains perfect fidelity extrapolating $100\times$ beyond training ($L=50 \to 5000$), consistent with a theoretically indefinite causal horizon, whereas Transformers lose logical coherence. Ablation studies indicate this protection emerges strictly from non-Abelian gauge symmetry. This provides strong evidence for a new universality class for logical reasoning, linking causal stability to the topology of the semantic manifold.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05240v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine learning short-ranged many-body interactions in colloidal systems using descriptors based on Voronoi cells</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19044</link><description>arXiv:2502.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interactions and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.19044v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Characterizing the cage state of glassy systems and its sensitivity to frozen boundaries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16339</link><description>arXiv:2507.16339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the cage state, a structural quantity that captures the average positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations only. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.16339v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Li+/H+ exchange in solid-state oxide Li-ion conductors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13477</link><description>arXiv:2509.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the moisture stability of oxide Li-ion conductors is important for their practical applications in solid-state batteries. Unlike sulfide or halide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in contact with water, but can still undergo topotactic \ch{Li+}/\ch{H+} exchange (LHX). Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning interatomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of the LHX reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor families: garnets and NASICONs. Li-stuffed garnets exhibit a strong driving force for proton exchange due to their high Li chemical potential. In contrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange due to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond covalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: Li stuffing enhances conductivity but increases moisture susceptibility. This study underscores the importance of designing Li-ion conductors that possess both high conductivity and high stability in practical environments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.13477v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A universal machine learning model for the electronic density of states</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17418</link><description>arXiv:2508.17418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.17418v2</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] MOFReasoner: Think Like a Scientist-A Reasoning Large Language Model via Knowledge Distillation</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00429B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00429B, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Xuefeng Bai, Zhiling  Zheng, Xin Zhang, Hao-Tian  Wang, Rui Yang, Jian-Rong Li&lt;br /&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have potential in transforming chemical research.

For chromophores in the condensed phase, these spectra, which incorporate the coupling between electronic excitation and molecular and solvent nuclear motions, can be simulated using excitation energies obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of the chromophore and solvent. Here, we present a hybrid scheme that exploits machine learning and physically informed spectral densities to show that as few as 25 ground and excited state energetic gradient calculations can be used to construct models that accurately predict environment-influenced vibronic coupling in optical spectra. We demonstrate our approach for the green fluorescent protein chromophore in water and the cresyl violet chromophore in methanol. We show that our hybrid approach, employing a machine learning model for the high-frequency spectral density and an ab initio parameterized Debye spectral density for the low-frequency, results in systematic improvement of the optical absorption lineshape, leading to a simple machine learning scheme that can be used for simulation of spectral densities and optical spectra.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-r7kfr?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] MolPic: Name/SMILES to Publication-Ready Molecular Figures</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wjnk9?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Here, we present MolPic, an open-source Python-based software that can be used to generate high-resolution, publication-quality molecular figures directly from compound names or SMILES strings.

By employing optical fibers as active photonic control elements, OFC achieves gen- uine coplanar coupling of photons, electrons, and ions within a single membrane electrode, thereby overcoming the intrinsic spatial separation that limits conven- tional thermal catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photoelectrochemical systems. This architecture establishes an essential physical foundation for pro- grammable chemistry and artificial intelligence–driven chemical systems. Optical Fiber Chemical Catalysis (OFC) represents the most substantial ad- vance in photo–electro and multi-field synergistic catalysis since the seminal demon- stration of photoelectrochemical water splitting by Fujishima and Honda in 1972. Here, we define the concepts of optical fiber chemistry and optical fiber chemi- cal catalysis, delineate their fundamental elements, and formulate the underlying catalytic laws. The OFC framework enables economical, safe, efficient, and high– energy-density scale-up or distributed deployment of optical fiber chemical reaction units, forming modular optical fiber chemical stacks. Moreover, the OFC platform allows chemical reaction processes to be programmably regulated and serves as a core chemical platform for artificial intelligence laboratories and intelligent chemical manufacturing. Catalytic principle: The central feature of OFC is a sandwich-structured optical-fiber membrane electrode, in which rational structural design enables the synergistic coupling of optical fields, electric fields, and proton/ion transport path- ways at a single reaction interface. Within this architecture, photons, electrons, protons, ions, catalysts, reactants, and products coexist at the same interface, allowing photonic excitation and charge separation to occur synchronously and thereby markedly enhancing catalytic efficiency. On the basis of these principles, optical fiber chemical catalysis is expected to enable key reactions—including am- monia synthesis, noble-metal-free fuel cells, organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical manufacturing—under ambient temperature and pressure. Over the next decade, OFC is anticipated to emerge as a major technological route in chemical engineering and catalysis.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-tqklf?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] ReactionForge: Temporal Graph Networks with Cross-Attention and Evidential Learning Surpass State-of-the-Art in Suzuki-Miyaura Yield Prediction</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-lrn7z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields remains essential for accelerating synthesis optimization, yet current machine learning models face critical limitations in capturing temporal dynamics, providing calibrated uncertainty estimates, and explicitly modeling reactant-to-product transformations. Here we introduce ReactionForge, a novel Temporal Graph Network architecture specifically designed for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling yield prediction that addresses these challenges through five key innovations. First, we implement persistent temporal memory mechanisms using Gated Recurrent Units to track catalyst evolution and reagent dynamics across reaction sequences. Second, we develop cross-attention layers that explicitly compare reactant and product molecular graphs, learning which structural changes most influence reaction outcomes. Third, we incorporate hierarchical graph pooling via Self-Attention Graph Pooling to automatically discover functional group patterns. Fourth, we employ evidential deep learning to provide calibrated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in a single forward pass. Fifth, we use multi-task learning with yield, selectivity, and reaction time as joint objectives to improve generalization. Evaluated on 5,760 Suzuki-Miyaura reactions spanning five metal catalysts and diverse substrates, ReactionForge achieves R² = 0.968 ± 0.004 (RMSE = 5.12 ± 0.18%, MAE = 3.89 ± 0.12%), representing statistically significant improvements over YieldGNN (R² = 0.957 ± 0.005, paired t-test p = 0.002) and YieldBERT (R² = 0.810 ± 0.010, p &lt; 0.001). The model provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates (Expected Calibration Error = 0.031) that enable uncertainty-guided active learning, achieving 37% improved data efficiency over random sampling. Systematic ablation studies reveal that each architectural component contributes measurably to performance, with cross-attention and temporal memory each adding approximately ΔR² = 0.005. Interpretability analysis shows that learned attention weights successfully recover known structure-reactivity relationships, including chloride activation challenges and ligand-substrate compatibility patterns. Despite architectural complexity, ReactionForge trains 28% faster than YieldGNN. This work demonstrates that chemically motivated architectural innovations in graph neural networks can meaningfully advance reaction prediction when properly grounded in mechanistic understanding.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-lrn7z?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Organic ionic plastic crystals composed of tetrahydrothiophenium cation with high conductivity</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-vk62v?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs) are soft crystalline materials that exhibit plasticity and ionic conductivity, making them promising candidates for use as solid electrolytes. Previously, IPCs based on pyrrolidinium cations derived from the heterocyclic five-membered ring pyrrolidine have been synthesized, and their ionic conductivities have been reported. However, their performance has not yet achieved the required standard. In this study, we focused on tetrahydrothiophene, another five-membered heterocyclic compound, as a novel cationic structure. A series of novel IPCs was synthesized using tetrahydrothiophenium cations in combination with five different anions, yielding 15 compounds. Thermal analysis was conducted to determine the decomposition and phase-transition temperatures. Six of the synthesized compounds were identified as IPCs, and five were classified as ionic liquids. Among them, the compound 1-ethyltetrahydrothiphenium trifluoro(trifluoromethyl)borate ([C₂tht][CF₃BF₃]), consisting of ethyl-substituted tetrahydrothiophenium cation and CF₃BF₃ anion, exhibited an ionic conductivity of 7.19 × 10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ at 25 °C. Notably, [C₂tht][CF₃BF₃] demonstrated an approximately one order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity at room temperature than conventional pyrrolidinium-based IPCs.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-vk62v?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Applied Physics Reviews Current Issue] Ferroelectric and ferroionic multifunctional quantum sensors: Incursion into applications</title><link>https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apr/article/13/1/011306/3377141/Ferroelectric-and-ferroionic-multifunctional</link><description>&lt;span class="paragraphSection"&gt;Ferroelectric materials are poised to drive the next technological leap through their emergent functionalities, including negative capacitance and resistance, charge accumulation without transport, and spontaneous polarization switching.

Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03801v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Material exploration through active learning -- METAL</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03933</link><description>arXiv:2601.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and design of new materials are paramount in the development of green technologies. High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03933v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Transport properties in a model of confined granular mixtures at moderate densities</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04026</link><description>arXiv:2601.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work derives the Navier--Stokes hydrodynamic equations for a model of a confined, quasi-two-dimensional, $s$-component mixture of inelastic, smooth, hard spheres. Using the inelastic version of the revised Enskog theory, macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are obtained, and constitutive equations for the fluxes are determined through a first-order Chapman--Enskog expansion. As for elastic collisions, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Approximate solutions to these equations for diffusion transport coefficients and shear viscosity are achieved by assuming steady-state conditions and considering leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. These transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the mixture's components, and the system's density. The results apply to moderate densities and are not limited to particular values of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, mass, and/or diameter ratios. As an application, the thermal diffusion factor is evaluated to analyze segregation driven by temperature gradients and gravity, providing criteria that distinguish whether larger particles accumulate near the hotter or colder boundaries.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04026v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] libMobility: A Python library for hydrodynamics at the Smoluchowski level</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02135</link><description>arXiv:2510.02135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective hydrodynamic modeling is crucial for accurately predicting fluid-particle interactions in diverse fields such as biophysics and materials science. Developing and implementing hydrodynamic algorithms is challenging due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, necessitating efficient management of large-scale computations and sophisticated boundary conditions. Furthermore, adapting these algorithms for use on massively parallel architectures like GPUs adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents the libMobility software library, which offers a suite of CUDA-enabled solvers for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particulate systems at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level. The library facilitates precise simulations of particle displacements influenced by external forces and torques, including both the deterministic and stochastic components. Notable features of libMobility include its ability to handle linear and angular displacements, thermal fluctuations, and various domain geometries effectively. With an interface in Python, libMobility provides comprehensive tools for researchers in computational fluid dynamics and related fields to simulate particle mobility efficiently. This article details the technical architecture, functionality, and wide-ranging applications of libMobility. libMobility is available at https://github.com/stochasticHydroTools/libMobility.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02135v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24978</link><description>arXiv:2509.24978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.24978v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link><description>arXiv:2512.23010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23010v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] The unique example of approximation of the electronic term of diatomic molecules by Morse potential. HF, DF, TF.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-z97tt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The Morse approximations M1(r) and M2(r) of the 1Σ+ ground state potential curves of three hydrofluoride isotopologues are analyzed. Qualitative differences between HF and heavy isotopologues were found. The result of the HF approximation is a function mainly described by the characteristics of a simple term. For HF, the anharmonicity M1(r) is lower than for M2(r), ωехе&lt;ωехе' and De&gt;D', therefore the curve M1(r) lies above U(r). The M2(r) model is constructed from the values of ωе and De, using the equation De=ωе2/4ωехе, so that its potential curve lies below U(r). For DF and TF, the anharmonicity of M1(r) is greater than of M2(r), ωехе&gt;ωехе' and De&lt;D', therefore, the curve M1(r) lies below U(r) and is outside its potential well with possible intersections. For DF and TF this results in the emergence of inversion of anharmonicity. The shape of U(r) for all three molecules is well described by the Morse formula, their parameters are close to each other, and the differences between HF and heavy isotopologues are small. The differences between the extrapolated and true De values for HF, DF, TF are 290, -230, -460 cm-1, and the differences between the values of anharmonicities ωехе and ωехе' are -0.51, 0.22, 0.30 cm-1, i.e. within 0.5‒1%. In the plot of the differences δ(r)≡U(r)‒M(r), the curves M2(r) of the three isotopologues are in the upper half-plane. The curve δ(r) M1(r) HF, which has not experienced an inversion, is also located there due to the small differences ∆ωехe and ∆De. It has the Morse potential shape, similar to M2(r), and its amplitude is lower than that for M2(r). For DF and TF, the amplitude of δ(r) for M1(r) is greater than δ(r) for M2(r), and their maxima coincide. Inversion of anharmonicity changes only the model term, therefore, a section of the δ(r) curves distorted by the Herzberg anomaly remains in the negative half-plane, because of the broadening of the U(r) term in the lower part of the potential well. This area occupies about half of its depth.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-z97tt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine-Learning-Accelerated Simulations of Vibrational Activation for Controlled Photoisomerization in a Molecular Motor</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wlm7r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The precise manipulation of photochemical reactions across broad configurational spaces requires sophisticated design of external control fields. Using the photoisomerization of a molecular motor as a prototype, this study integrates enhanced sampling and active learning to construct accurate machine-learned multi-state potential energy surfaces (PESs). By combining active-learning trajectories with enhanced sampling, our approach efficiently covers substantial reaction regions, enabling trajectory propagation extending to tens of picoseconds at a low computational cost within the machine learning framework. Furthermore, local control theory (LCT) is employed to selectively activate specific vibrational motions, leading to accelerated access to reactive regions, enhanced nonadiabatic transitions, and significantly improved selectivity toward the dominant photoproduct. This combined strategy of machine-learning potentials and LCT offers an efficient and generalizable framework for controlling excited-state dynamics in complex systems.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-wlm7r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5d9nq-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Materials] Extracting and reconstructing knowledge in materials science literature using large language models</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01043-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Materials, Published online: 08 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-01043-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/s43246-025-01043-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reconstructing knowledge on synthesis routes and properties from inorganic science literature is crucial yet challenging, particularly in maintaining completeness and logical consistency.

Two ambient pressure phases (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pna&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and  I4¯2d) and two high-pressure phases ( R3¯m and  Fd3¯m) were identified, all of which are dynamically, mechanically, and thermally stable, and exhibit semiconductor characteristics. Notably, their bandgaps increase with increasing pressure. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to two factors. First, the strengthened orbital coupling under pressure enhances electron cloud overlap, raising the energy of antibonding states (conduction band) and lowering the energy of bonding states (valence band). Second, high pressure alters the distribution of electron clouds, causing electrons to become more localized around the atoms. This localized electron distribution reduces electron transitions between energy bands, thereby increasing the bandgap. This analysis provides a unified view of the electronic structure evolution under compression, linking microscopic orbital interactions to macroscopic observable properties. The calculations and analysis of the optical absorption and reflectivity coefficient suggest that the two high-pressure phases of MgPbN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have potential applications in transparent optics and ultraviolet detection.

Abstract: The synthesis of nanocrystals has been highly dependent on trial-and-error, due to the complex correlation between synthesis parameters and physicochemical properties. Although deep learning offers a potential methodology to achieve generative inverse design, it is still hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align nanocrystal synthesis routes with their properties. Here, we present the construction of a large-scale, aligned Nanocrystal Synthesis-Property (NSP) database and demonstrate its capability for generative inverse design. To extract structured synthesis routes and their corresponding product properties from literature, we develop NanoExtractor, a large language model (LLM) enhanced by well-designed augmentation strategies. NanoExtractor is validated against human experts, achieving a weighted average score of 88% on the test set, significantly outperforming chemistry-specialized (3%) and general-purpose LLMs (38%). The resulting NSP database contains nearly 160,000 aligned entries and serves as training data for our NanoDesigner, an LLM for inverse synthesis design. The generative capability of NanoDesigner is validated through the successful design of viable synthesis routes for both well-established PbSe nanocrystals and rarely reported MgF2 nanocrystals. Notably, the model recommends a counter-intuitive, non-stoichiometric precursor ratio (1:1) for MgF2 nanocrystals, which is experimentally confirmed as critical for suppressing byproducts. Our work bridges the gap between unstructured literature and data-driven synthesis, and also establishes a powerful human-AI collaborative paradigm for accelerating nanocrystal discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02424v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02699</link><description>arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02699v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Interplay of Structure and Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes: a Molecular Dynamics Study of LiPF6/polypropylene carbonate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02869</link><description>arXiv:2601.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02869v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DeepH-pack: A general-purpose neural network package for deep-learning electronic structure calculations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02938</link><description>arXiv:2601.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational physics and materials science, first-principles methods, particularly density functional theory, have become central tools for electronic structure prediction and materials design. Recently, rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have begun to reshape the research landscape, giving rise to the emerging field of deep-learning electronic structure calculations. Despite numerous pioneering studies, the field remains in its early stages; existing software implementations are often fragmented, lacking unified frameworks and standardized interfaces required for broad community adoption. Here we present DeepH-pack, a comprehensive and unified software package that integrates first-principles calculations with deep learning. By incorporating fundamental physical principles into neural-network design, such as the nearsightedness principle and the equivariance principle, DeepH-pack achieves robust cross-scale and cross-material generalizability. This allows models trained on small-scale structures to generalize to large-scale and previously unseen materials. The toolkit preserves first-principles accuracy while accelerating electronic structure calculations by several orders of magnitude, establishing an efficient and intelligent computational paradigm for large-scale materials simulation, high-throughput materials database construction, and AI-driven materials discovery.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02938v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Novel fast Li-ion conductors for solid-state electrolytes from first-principles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03151</link><description>arXiv:2601.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-throughput computational screening for fast lithium-ion conductors to identify promising materials for application in all solid-state electrolytes. Starting from more than 30,000 Li-containing experimental structures sourced from Crystallography Open Database, Inorganic Crystal Structure Database and Materials Platform for Data Science, we perform highly automated calculations to identify electronic insulators. On these ~1000 structures, we use molecular dynamics simulations to estimate Li-ion diffusivities using the pinball model, which describes the potential energy landscape of diffusing lithium with accuracy similar to density functional theory while being 200-500 times faster. Then we study the ~60 most promising and previously unknown fast conductors with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures to estimate their activation barriers. The results are discussed in detail for the 9 fastest conductors, including $Li_7NbO_6$ which shows a remarkable ionic conductivity of ~5 mS/cm at room temperature. We further present the entire screening protocol, including the workflows where the accuracy of the pinball model is improved self-consistently, necessary to automatically running the required calculations and analysing their results.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03151v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link><description>arXiv:2601.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.03207v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Machine Learning H-theorem</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14003</link><description>arXiv:2508.14003v3 Announce Type: replace

The characteristics of Bloch oscillation are different in the two phases. In the zero-momentum phase, the Bloch oscillation is harmonic while it is anharmonic in the plane-wave phase. The amplitude of Bloch oscillation is found to be affected by the helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling. We examine that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14873v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Tuning Separator Chemistry: Improving Zn Anode Compatibility via Functionalized Chitin Nanofibers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19449</link><description>arXiv:2512.19449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.19449v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Unsupervised Topological Phase Discovery in Periodically Driven Systems via Floquet-Bloch State</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24822</link><description>arXiv:2512.24822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v2</guid></item><item><title>[tandf: Materials Research Letters: Table of Contents] Physical-information machine learning for strength and ductility prediction of metastable β titanium alloys</title><link>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21663831.2025.2611741?af=R</link><description>. &lt;br /&gt;</description><author>tandf: Materials Research Letters: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 02:19:21 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">/doi/full/10.1080/21663831.2025.2611741?af=R</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Thermotropic liquid-assisted interface management enables efficient and stable perovskite solar cells and modules</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-68231-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In this work, Chang et al. report a thermotropic liquid additive for perovskite solar cells that enables dynamic interface management, simultaneously passivating defects and suppressing ion migration to deliver high efficiency and substantially enhanced operational stability.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68231-0</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Computational Community Blind Challenge on Pan-Coronavirus Drug Discovery Data</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zd9mr-v6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Computational blind challenges offer critical, unbiased assessment opportunities to assess and accelerate scientific progress, as demonstrated by a breadth of breakthroughs over the last decade. We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium’s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-zd9mr-v6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Uncertainty-aware machine learning to predict non-cancer human toxicity for the global chemicals market</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67374-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Uncertainty-aware machine learning models predict human toxicity for more than 100,000 chemicals, highlighting potency and uncertainty hotspots to guide safer use and to focus efforts to improve prediction confidence.</description><author>Nature Communications</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67374-4</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Learning EXAFS from atomic structure through physics-informed machine learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sv3f6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) provides element-specific access to local atomic environments and is widely used to relate structure and reactivity across chemical systems. However, quantitative EXAFS interpretation still relies on manually constructed structural models and extensive parameter tuning, creating a growing bottleneck as experimental datasets increase in size and complexity. Addressing this bottleneck requires a direct and systematic mapping between atomic structure and EXAFS response. Here we introduce AI-EXAFS, a physics-informed graph neural network that predicts full EXAFS spectra directly from three-dimensional atomic coordinates. By formulating the learning problem around the physical principles governing EXAFS signal formation, the model learns transferable structure–spectrum relationships and eliminates the need for user-defined parameter selection at inference. Trained on 86,000 transition-metal complexes, AI-EXAFS reproduces reference theoretical spectra with accuracy consistent with established EXAFS analysis practice and generalizes to experimentally relevant systems, including platinum single-atom catalysts. AI-EXAFS provides an accurate and readily deployable forward model for EXAFS, enabling standardized first-pass structural screening and offering a scalable foundation for future extensions toward more realistic and data-rich EXAFS analysis.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-sv3f6?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Defined by Shape: Elucidating the Molecular Recognition of Dynamic Loops with Covalent Ligands</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Protein loops harness conformational heterogeneity to perform an array of functions, ranging from catalyzing enzymatic reactions to communicating allosteric signals. Although attractive targets for small molecule modulation, these functional hubs are often considered unligandable due to their lack of well-defined binding pockets and highly dynamic structure. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated the power of covalent chemistry to selectively capture cryptic pockets formed by protein loops. Herein, we leverage machine learning to elucidate the molecular basis of covalent ligand:loop recognition in the transcriptional coactivator Med25. Key to our success was classification by ligand shape prior to model training, which led to descriptive and predictive models. The models were experimentally validated through the synthesis and in vitro testing of novel top-ranked ligands, revealing canonical structure-affinity relationships, including an activity cliff. Further feature analyses identified traditional topological and spatial parameters predictive of binding, and molecular modeling uncovered a potential binding pocket with at least two distinct conformations with high shape complementarity. Collectively, these findings reveal the hidden potential of dynamic loops as specific sites for covalent small molecule modulation, challenging the notion that protein loops are unligandable and demonstrating their capacity for exquisite, shape-based molecular recognition.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qwc85?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] QuantumPDB: A Workflow for High-Throughput Quantum Cluster Model Generation from Protein Structures</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Computational modeling of enzymes provides molecular-level insight into catalysis, but the preparation of quantum mechanical (QM) calculations starting from experimental structures is a significant bottleneck for high-throughput studies. Automated tools developed to accelerate this process may fail to generalize across distinct active site chemistries and geometries. To overcome these limitations, we present QuantumPDB, a Python package that automates the generation of hierarchical coordination/interaction spheres around an active center to create QM cluster models directly from raw protein structures. The workflow integrates structure cleaning, protonation state assignment, and QM calculation setup. It uses chemically meaningful models constructed from contact-based interaction spheres derived from Voronoi tessellation, enabling accurate representation of complex active site geometries. We provide an overview of our modular code and describe how it may be employed to automate high-throughput protein screening. To demonstrate its utility, we curated a dataset of 989 holo-enzymes from the PDB and performed QM calculations on 1,673 enzyme cluster models of 842 of these enzymes. Analysis of computed properties suggests that enzyme environments simulated with density functional theory consistently modulate substrate charge toward neutrality and reduce the substrate dipole moment. This phenomenon appears to be general, even in cases where the active site consists predominantly of neutral residues. By automating and standardizing multi-sphere QM model construction, QuantumPDB provides a robust platform for large-scale, data-driven investigations of proteins.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-w5x1d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Generalization and Usability of Co-Folded GPCR–Ligand Complexes: A Physics-Guided Assessment</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deep learning co-folding models for end-to-end protein–ligand structure prediction mark a major advance beyond AlphaFold2, yet their reliability for decision-making in drug discovery remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Boltz, a state-of-the-art co-folding model, using a curated set of ligand-bound human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from families unseen during training. We find that the receptor backbones are generally predicted with reasonable accuracy, but ligand poses often deviate significantly from experimental structures. We then evaluate physics-based refinement with rigid-receptor (Glide) and induced-fit docking (IFD-MD) methods, which recover more than half of the misplaced ligands to near-experimental accuracy. As conventional evaluations for co-folded structures focus on distance-based metrics such as root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD), which can miss subtle but consequential binding-site errors, we carry out a further assessment of Boltz performance using free-energy perturbation (FEP+), which is both accurate and sensitive to starting-structure quality, on curated congeneric ligand series with known binding affinities that target the GPCRs. A significant fraction of the 14 congeneric series tested in this fashion fail to reproduce experimental binding affinities via FEP+ when employing the Boltz generated complex, even when the binding-site RMSD is low in some cases. IFD-MD rescues these failures and restores retrospective FEP signals to native-like level for all of these series. Together, these results delineate current generalization and usability limits of co-folded GPCR–ligand complexes and motivate a workflow that pairs deep learning predictions with physics-based refinement and validation before high-stakes decisions in drug discovery.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-1rkqz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Communications Physics] Interpolation-based coordinate descent method for parameterized quantum circuits</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Communications Physics, Published online: 07 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02473-8"&gt;doi:10.1038/s42005-025-02473-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parameterized quantum circuits are a common tool in variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

We present ConfDENSE, a Set2Set enhanced PointNet model that learns directly from Hirshfeld promolecule electron-density point clouds, preserving full 3D electronic in- formation without downsampling.Despite using no receptor structural data, ConfDENSE accurately identifies bioac- tive conformers from ensemble inputs. For the only available human odorant receptor structures, the model’s selected conformers achieve sub-angstrom RMSDs to crystallo- graphic ligand poses and frequently outperform conventional docking. Combining ConfDENSE with explainability analysis further reveals the substruc- tures most responsible for receptor engagement, aligning with experimental interaction patterns. This ligand-centric and interpretable framework naturally supports phar- macophore extraction and scaffold-based design, enabling identification of conserved binding motifs even when receptor structures are missing. ConfDENSE thus provides a compact, physics-aware approach to computational olfaction, linking electron density, conformational preference, and odorant recognition in a structurally agnostic manner.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8tmtg?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] MOSES: combining automated ontology construction with a multi-agent system for explainable chemical knowledge reasoning</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</link><description>The vast and multiscale nature of chemical knowledge—from molecular structures to material properties—presents significant challenges for both human researchers and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. While large language models (LLMs) can process chemical information, they operate as black boxes without transparent reasoning. Here, we present our multi-agent ontology system for explainable knowledge synthesis (MOSES), a framework that combines automated knowledge organization with multi-agent collaboration to create an AI system for interpretable chemical knowledge reasoning. Using supramolecular chemistry as a testbed, we automatically constructed an ontology of over 10 000 classes from 52 publications and developed a multi-agent system that enables transparent knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Evaluations by human experts and LLMs show that MOSES significantly outperforms chemistry-oriented LLMs and leading general-purpose LLMs—including GPT-4.1 and o3—as well as GraphRAG-augmented GPT-4.1 models, on complex chemical questions, achieving superior scores in both direct assessments and Elo ratings. MOSES’s traceable reasoning paths reveal how it constructs answers through iterative refinement rather than probabilistic generation. However, we observe an asymmetry in handling positive versus negative knowledge claims, underscoring fundamental challenges in open-world reasoning. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward AI systems that can reason over complex scientific knowledge in a transparent and explainable manner.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae3127</guid></item><item><title>[Cell Reports Physical Science] A review of advancements and challenges in nanoplastics detection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(25)00641-1?rss=yes</link><description>Zhang et al. review cutting-edge strategies for separating, detecting, and characterizing nanoplastics across environmental and biological systems.

However, low mechanical strength of carbon matrix is incapable of maintaining structural stability and electron/ion conductivity of Si anodes. Herein, we employ electrospinning-carbonization to construct free-standing Si@carbon nanofibers with internal ordered channels, uniformly distributed Si nanoparticles, and extraordinary elastic modulus (0.22 GPa) by introducing polystyrene as an oriented filler. The free-standing and rigid-flexible ordered multichannel carbon nanofibers (OM-CNFs) can absorb the volume variation of Si, effectively enhancing the mechanical strength and chemical stability of electrodes. The Si nanoparticles uniformly embedded into the highly conductive OM-CNFs matrix establish a bicontinuous structure and increase the contact area between Si and CNFs, thus boosting the rate capability.

Abstract: Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00855v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Chemically Grounded Evaluation Framework for Generative Models in Materials Discovery</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00886</link><description>arXiv:2601.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00886v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link><description>arXiv:2601.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01010v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Predicting Coherent B2 Stability in Ru-Containing Refractory Alloys Through Thermodynamic Elastic Design Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01326</link><description>arXiv:2601.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01326v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Common sublattice-pure van Hove singularities in the kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01428</link><description>arXiv:2601.01428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01428v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] A Universal Model for the Resting Potential in Nanofluidic Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01536</link><description>arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01536v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Anharmonic lattice dynamics study of phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal indium iodides</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01766</link><description>arXiv:2601.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium iodides, which adopt layered or molecular-crystal-like arrangements depending on composition, are expected to exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity because of their heavy constituent atoms and weak In-I bonding. In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01766v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Spin-correlation Driven Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in a Perovskite Quantum Spin-liquid System, Ba3CuSb2O9</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01906</link><description>arXiv:2601.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01906v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Score-based diffusion models for accurate crystal-structure inpainting and reconstruction of hydrogen positions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01959</link><description>arXiv:2601.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01959v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept and FFT methods in micromechanics of composites subjected to body force with compact support</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00822</link><description>arXiv:2601.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider static linear elastic composite materials (CMs) with periodic structure. The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] AutoPot: Automated and massively parallelized construction of Machine-Learning Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01185</link><description>arXiv:2601.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.
  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01185v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link><description>arXiv:2601.02150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.02150v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link><description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.23783v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Efficient Identification of Critical Transitions via Flow Matching: A Scalable Generative Approach for Many-Body Systems</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link><description>arXiv:2508.15318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching (FM) to identify critical properties in many-body systems efficiently. Using the 2D XY model as a benchmark, we demonstrate that a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, effectively generalizes across both temperature and system size. This dual generalization enables two primary applications for large-scale computational physics: (i) a rapid "train-small, predict-large" strategy to locate phase transition points for significantly larger systems ($128\times 128$) without retraining, facilitating efficient finite-size scaling analysis; and (ii) the fast generation of high-fidelity, decorrelated initial spin configurations for large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, providing a robust starting point that bypasses the long thermalization times of traditional samplers. These capabilities arise from the combination of the Flow Matching framework, which learns stable probability-flow vector fields, and the inductive biases of the U-Net architecture that capture scale-invariant local correlations. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient tool for exploring the thermodynamic limit, serving as both a rapid explorer for phase boundaries and a high-performance initializer for high-precision studies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.15318v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Graph atomic cluster expansion for foundational machine learning interatomic potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17936</link><description>arXiv:2508.17936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials that can accurately and efficiently model a vast range of materials are critical for accelerating atomistic discovery. We introduce universal potentials based on the graph atomic cluster expansion (GRACE) framework, trained on several of the largest available materials datasets. Through comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that the GRACE models establish a new Pareto front for accuracy versus efficiency among foundational interatomic potentials. We further showcase their exceptional versatility by adapting them to specialized tasks and simpler architectures via fine-tuning and knowledge distillation, achieving high accuracy while preventing catastrophic forgetting. This work establishes GRACE as a robust and adaptable foundation for the next generation of atomistic modeling, enabling high-fidelity simulations across the periodic table.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.17936v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] DeFecT-FF: Accelerated Modeling of Defects in Cd-Zn--Te-Se-S Compounds Combining High-Throughput DFT and Machine Learning Force Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23514</link><description>arXiv:2510.23514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23514v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams to rationalize the nucleation and quenchability of metastable $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05841</link><description>arXiv:2512.05841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ is a promising solid-state electrolyte with the highest ionic conductivity among its polymorphs. However, its formation presents a thermodynamic paradox: the $\alpha$-phase is the equilibrium phase at high temperature and transforms to the stable $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ polymorph when cooled to room temperature; however, $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ can be synthesized and quenched in a metastable state via rapid heating at relatively low temperatures. The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. This size-dependent stabilization is directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation. This work presents a generalizable framework that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic factors for understanding nucleation and phase transformation mechanisms, providing a rational strategy for the targeted synthesis of functional metastable materials.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05841v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Linear magnetoresistance of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13475</link><description>arXiv:2512.13475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.13475v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Insights Into Radiation Damage in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ From Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24430</link><description>arXiv:2512.24430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Controllable diatomic molecular quantum thermodynamic machines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03131</link><description>arXiv:2504.03131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system operates as a quantum heat engine across the range of parameters considered. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.03131v2</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A Systematic Review of Prompt Engineering Paradigms in Organic Chemistry: Mining, Prediction, and Model Architectures</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-625v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in scientific research, offering a powerful alternative to traditional, resource-intensive machine learning methods. By leveraging the vast knowledge encoded during pre-training, prompt engineering—the systematic design and optimization of input instructions—enables researchers to guide LLMs toward accurate and domain-specific outputs without updating model parameters. This review presents the first systematic examination of prompt engineering techniques within organic chemistry, focusing on two critical application areas: text mining and predictive tasks. We analyze the core paradigms of prompt engineering, including prompt design, prompt learning, and prompt tuning, and clarify terminological inconsistencies in the literature. The discussion is contextualized within the three principal LLM architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder), with an evaluation of their respective performances on chemistry-related tasks.  Furthermore, we explore practical workflows for extracting structured chemical data from texts and knowledge graphs, as well as advanced prompt strategies for reaction condition prediction, reaction optimization, and catalytic performance prediction. This review highlights the significant potential of LLM-driven prompt engineering to accelerate discovery in organic chemistry, from synthetic pathway optimization to automated literature analysis, while also addressing persistent challenges such as the limitations associated with various prompt engineering techniques and the constraints related to each related sub-task. We conclude by outlining future research directions aimed at deepening the integration of chemical knowledge with evolving AI methodologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-625v3?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ensemble Analyzer: An Open-Source Python Framework for Automated Conformer Ensemble Refinement</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-kq1wk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Accurate prediction of molecular properties often requires considering the full conformational ensemble rather than a single optimized structure. While modern sampling tools have revolutionized conformational sampling by enabling the rapid generation of ensembles, the subsequent refinement at higher levels of theory remains computationally demanding and technically complex. Existing workflows typically rely on ad hoc scripts and manual intervention, limiting reproducibility and accessibility.
Here, we present Ensemble Analyzer (EnAn), an open-source Python framework designed to automate the refinement and analysis of conformational ensembles. Built on the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), EnAn integrates seamlessly with widely known quantum chemistry engines such as ORCA and Gaussian, providing a modular and extensible architecture that streamlines the entire pipeline. EnAn also supports automated generation and comparison of electronic and vibronic spectra, enabling rapid visualization and interpretation. By minimizing manual data handling and standardizing workflows, EnAn effectively manages reproducible exploration of complex conformational spaces.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-kq1wk?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Electrostatic Patterning Controls Mineral Nucleation Inside Ferritin</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8bq1h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ferritin protein nanocages store iron across nearly all living organisms.  In mammals, two subtypes of ferritin exist: heavy (H) chain and light (L) chain.  They have very similar 3D structures, but each performs a slightly different role in iron mineral formation.  How sequence differences between the two subtypes affect mineral formation within the nanocages is still unclear.  Single-particle reconstruction of cryo-TEM images was used to build models of unmineralized and partially mineralized human L-chain and H-chain ferritin, which showed that subtle differences in protein structure led to changes in the location of mineral formation within ferritin.  Explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore how sequence-dependent electrostatics modulate ion transport, cluster formation, and mineral nucleation within the confined environment of human L- and H-chain apoferritin nanocages. Employing NaCl as a computational probe, we show that the internal charge distribution governs ion selectivity and nucleation pathways.  Analysis of liquid and solid ionic clusters, combined with Markov State Models (MSMs), reveals that mineralization proceeds through a two-step mechanism involving dense liquid-like precursors that crystallize homogeneously within the cavity.  These findings provide molecular insight into how ferritin sequence variability tunes confinement-driven nucleation and suggest general principles for designing biomimetic nanoreactors.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-8bq1h?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Machine Learning Prediction of Henry Coefficients of Polar and Nonpolar Gases in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Effects of Interlayer Shifts and Functionalization</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ps69l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for gas separation and carbon capture. Computational techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation can be used to predict the gas adsorption properties of COFs with high accuracy, however they are too inefficient to be deployed in a high-throughput manner for screening large COF databases. In this paper, we systematically train and evaluate a range of machine learning models for predicting the Henry coefficients for CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption in COF materials. To account for COF structural variability, we train our models on datasets that include both chemically functionalized frameworks and interlayer displaced stacking configurations. By comparing predictive performance across descriptor–model architecture combinations, we demonstrate how different models capture the key physical factors governing gas adsorption, including electrostatics, local atomic environments, and van der Waals interactions. Our results therefore provide a framework for building machine learning models for scalable, high-throughput screening of COF materials with targeted gas adsorption properties.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-ps69l?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Bridging the Gap: Aqueous Phase Organic Synthesis as a Foundation for Advanced Chemical and Biological Discovery</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hw4d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>For over a century, synthetic chemistry demanded the rigorous exclusion of water, relying on toxic, volatile organic solvents. This paradigm, while successful, is environmentally and economically costly. This review advocates for a fundamental shift: adopting water not just as a green solvent, but as a transformative medium that reshapes our understanding of reactivity and bridges chemistry with biology. Aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) has evolved from accidental observations to a deliberate discipline. Water’s unique properties—its high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and the hydrophobic effect—make it an active participant. This effect drives reactant aggregation and stabilizes transition states, leading to dramatic rate enhancements in pericyclic and condensation reactions. A broad range of reactions thrive in water, including classical carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions like the aldol and Diels–Alder, and modern cross-couplings (e.g., Suzuki–Miyaura) enabled by water-tolerant catalysts. Multicomponent and click chemistries are particularly powerful. Challenges like poor solubility are addressed with micellar catalysis, water-soluble ligands, and precise control of the reaction microenvironment. Beyond sustainability, APOS drives discovery, often yielding improved selectivities, new pathways, and streamlined syntheses of complex targets like pharmaceuticals. Its greatest promise lies in interfacing with biology. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as azide–alkyne cycloadditions, enable labeling and imaging in living organisms. Aqueous compatibility is essential for in situ therapeutic strategies, chemical biology, and advanced bioconjugation techniques for modifying biomolecules. The future converges with emerging technologies: machine learning to navigate complex aqueous systems, flow chemistry for scalability, and the integration of enzymatic with synthetic catalysis. This points toward a unified chemical-biological engineering paradigm. In conclusion, APOS is a mature, versatile field. It is a cornerstone of green chemistry and a critical bridge to biology, accelerating progress in medicine and materials science. Embracing water is both an environmental imperative and a strategic pathway to the next generation of scientific discovery.
Introduction: The Solvent Problem in Organic Synthesis
For generations, organic synthesis has been defined by precise control over molecular structure carried out in rigorously dried environments. Since the emergence of modern organic chemistry in the nineteenth century, water – the very medium that sustains life – has been regarded as an obstacle to chemical transformation. This long-standing assumption has shaped laboratory routines, industrial manufacturing, and chemical education, reinforcing the idea that successful synthesis depends on strict exclusion of moisture. This introduction revisits that historical mindset, evaluates its environmental and economic consequences, and presents the case for a fundamental transition toward aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) as a more suitable platform for future chemical and biological innovation.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-0hw4d?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

Abstract: As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00067v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Atomic-Scale Mechanisms of Li-Ion Transport Mediated by Li10GeP2S12 in Composite Solid Polyethylene Oxide Electrolytes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00112</link><description>arXiv:2601.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00112v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Engineering Ideal 2D Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals via Stacking and Intercalation of van der Waals Layers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00407</link><description>arXiv:2601.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional type-II topological semimetals (TSMs), characterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, have attracted intense interest for their unconventional electronic properties and exotic transport behaviors. However, rational design remains challenging due to the sensitivity of band tilting to lattice geometry, atomic coordination, and symmetry constraints. Here, we present a bottom-up approach to engineer ideal type-II nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) in van der Waals bilayers via atomic intercalation. Using monolayer $h$-AlN as a prototype, we show that fluorine-intercalated bilayer AlN (F@BL-AlN) hosts a symmetry-protected type-II nodal loop precisely at the Fermi level, enabled by preserved mirror symmetry ($\mathcal{M}_z$) and tailored interlayer hybridization. First-principles calculations reveal that fluorine not only tunes interlayer coupling but also aligns the Fermi energy with the nodal line, stabilizing the type-II NLSM phase. The system exhibits tunable electronic properties under external electric and strain fields and features a van Hove singularity that induces spontaneous ferromagnetism, realizing a ferromagnetic topological semimetal state. This work provides a versatile platform for designing type-II NLSMs and offers practical guidance for their experimental realization.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00407v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link><description>arXiv:2508.21012v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.21012v5</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00018</link><description>arXiv:2601.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating). In addition, new general integral equations (GIEs) are established for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading. A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00018v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Additive general integral equations in thermoelastic micromechanics of composites</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00019</link><description>arXiv:2601.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00019v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Accurate Screening of Functional Materials with Machine-Learning Potential and Transfer-Learned Regressions: Heusler Alloy Benchmark</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20556</link><description>arXiv:2508.20556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and $E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy. Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also benchmark the performance of different uMLIPs, discuss the fidelity of local magnetic moment prediction, and demonstrate generalization to unseen elements via transfer learning from a universal interatomic potential.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.20556v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166</link><description>arXiv:2509.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.06166v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Temperature and Pressure Dependent Vibrational Properties of Pristine and Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21810</link><description>arXiv:2512.21810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulatingthese properties remains poorly understood. We investigate the vibrational and optical properties of pristine and Antimony(Sb)-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ vacancy-ordered double perovskite through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4-273 K), high-pressure studies (0- \~30 GPa), ambient powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping improves phase purity, reducing impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine samples. Most notably, Sb-doped samples exhibit an anomalous Raman mode M$_1$ appearing exclusively below 100 K at 314-319 cm$^{-1}$, accompanied by changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. This behavior is absent in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$. While these observations suggest possible structural changes at low temperature, the origin of the M$_1$ mode remains unclear and may arise from disorder-activated vibrations, symmetry breaking, or dopant-induced local distortions. Low-temperature structural characterization is needed to confirm the nature of this transition. Photoluminescence shows broad self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm with broader FWHM in Sb-doped samples (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), consistent with enhanced structural disorder. High-pressure Raman measurements reveal continuous mode hardening to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These results demonstrate that Sb doping modulates the vibrational properties of Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, though further investigation is required to establish the underlying mechanisms.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.21810v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Support Vector Machine Kernels as Quantum Propagators</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11153</link><description>arXiv:2502.11153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting optimal kernels for regression in physical systems remains a challenge, often relying on trial-and-error with standard functions. In this work, we establish a mathematical correspondence between support vector machine kernels and quantum propagators, demonstrating that kernel efficacy is determined by its spectral alignment with the system's Green's function. Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels. Numerical experiments spanning electrical conductivity, electronic band structure, anharmonic oscillators, and photonic crystals demonstrate that this framework consistently performs well as long as there is an alignment with a Green's function.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2502.11153v3</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Ternary Transition Metal Oxides for Electrochemical Energy Storage: Synthesis, Advantages, Design Strategies, and Future Prospects</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) have emerged as a new class of electrode materials for high-performance energy storage systems, particularly supercapacitors (SCs) and hybrid battery-capacitor devices. This comprehensive review aims to comprehensively survey recent advances in the design, synthesis, and analysis of TTMOs-based nanostructures for supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. It begins by outlining the key concepts related to charge storage mechanisms in SC electrodes, electric double-layer capacitance (EDL), pseudocapacitive (PC), and battery-type (BT) behavior, followed by a clarification of device configurations, including symmetric SC (SSC), asymmetric SC (ASC), and hybrid SC (HSC) devices. This review then examines the fabrication strategies for TTMOs, emphasizing the impact of synthetic approaches on material morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemical performance. Special attention is given to the structure-property relationships that govern ion transport and charge storage dynamics in these materials. The influence of morphological features, including dimensionality, porosity, and hierarchical architecture, on electrochemical behavior is critically analyzed. A comparative evaluation of electrochemical matrices across various TTMO electrodes is presented, highlighting key performance and challenges. Ultimately, the review highlights emerging trends, current limitations, and future research directions that are poised to accelerate the development of next-generation TTMO materials for advanced energy storage technologies.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-2jncj-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Tunable Gelation and Viscoelasticity of Lung-Tissue–Mimetic Sealant: Linking Shear History to In Situ Mechanical Performance through Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process–structure–property framework for a gelatin–tannic acid–transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning.

Using small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 °C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G′– loss modulus, G″, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G′,  from ~10⁶ to ~10⁴ Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01–1 s⁻¹) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2–3 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G′–, from ≈3.5×10³ to ≈4×10² Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism.

To unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R² ≈ 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states.

This rheology–machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes—airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination—it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-zkrvp?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Discovery of β-Sheet Peptide Assembly Codes via an Experimentally Validated Predictive Computational Platform</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Deciphering the sequence codes governing ordered peptide assemblies remains challenging due to the need to explore vast sequence space with atomic resolution. Here, we present an experimentally validated computational framework combining hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics and machine learning for the discovery of β-sheet-rich amyloid-forming peptides. Through exhaustive simulations of all 8,000 tripeptides, we demonstrate that the widely used aggregation propensity (AP) is not effective in predicting β-sheet assembly. We introduce Amyloid-Like Tendency (ALT), a metric enabled by our hybrid-resolution simulations that effectively identifies cross-β architectures. Leveraging this physics-informed dataset, we further fine-tuned the Uni-Mol model to efficiently screen 160,000 tetrapeptides. Experimental validation of 46 candidates confirmed a predictive accuracy of ~85%, yielding 26 novel amyloid-forming peptides, including multiple hydrogelators. Mechanistic analysis reveals that specific sidechain stacking and central amino acid identity, beyond generic hydrophobicity, dictate ordered assembly. This establishes a scalable pipeline for the targeted design of functional peptide materials.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-4c5h0?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Continued Challenges in High-Throughput Materials Predictions: MatterGen predicts compounds from the training dataset.</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>High-throughput computational tools and generative AI models aim to revolutionise materials discovery by enabling the rapid prediction of novel inorganic compounds. However, these tools face persistent challenges with modelling compounds where multiple elements occupy the same crystallographic site, often leading to misclassification of known disordered phases as new ordered compounds. Recently, Microsoft revealed MatterGen as a tool for predicting new materials. As a proof of concept, MatterGen was used to predict the novel compound TaCr2O6, which was subsequently synthesised in a disordered form as Ta1/3Cr2/3O2. However, detailed crystallographic analysis, presented in this paper, reveals that this is not a novel compound but is identical to the already known compound Ta1/2Cr1/2O2 reported in 1972 and actually included in MatterGen’s training dataset. These findings underscore the necessity of rigorous human verification in AI-assisted materials research, limiting their use for rapid and large-scale prediction of new materials. While generative models hold great promise, their effectiveness is currently limited by unresolved issues with disorder prediction and dataset validation. Improved integration with crystallographic expertise is essential to realise their full potential.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-mkls8-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Pressure- and Temperature-Dependent Ionic Transport in Ag₄Zr₃S₈ Nanocrystal Pellets</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Nanocrystal (NC)–derived solid electrolytes provide access to compositionally complex and metastable ion conductors, yet their measured transport properties are often dominated by extrinsic contact effects. We probe the coupled roles of temperature, uniaxial pressure, pellet microstructure, and electrode material on the electrochemical impedance response of Ag₄Zr₃S₈ NC pellets. Ag₄Zr₃S₈ NCs were synthesized via colloidal routes using distinct sulfur sources and consolidated into pellets with controlled surface chemistry. EIS was performed over 298–393 K and 0.43–8.67 MPa using blocking and non-blocking electrodes. Pressure-dependent Nyquist analysis shows impedance is overwhelmingly dominated by interfacial and constriction resistances, with pressure primarily reducing contact limitations rather than altering intrinsic ion transport. Temperature–pressure heat maps of the high-frequency resistance reveal thermally activated transport strongly modulated by mechanical contact and electrode compatibility. These results establish pressure-resolved impedance spectroscopy as a diagnostic framework for separating intrinsic and extrinsic transport contributions in NC-based solid electrolytes.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-t7qrx?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Mechanistic Evidence for Dibutyl Phthalate as an Environmental Trigger for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02880-9?rss=yes</link><description>Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is a ubiquitous pollutant, but its molecular link to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undefined.

Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-5d9nq?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Cellulose Coating Altered the Electro-Chemo-Mechanical Evolution of Sodium Thioantimonate Electrolyte in Solid-state Sodium Batteries: An Operando Raman Study</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) attracted increasing attention due to their improved safety and energy densities; yet electrolyte decomposition and subsequent contact loss limited the interfacial stability of ASSBs. Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC’s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte. The deep mechanistic insights unravel the exact modification needed for improved interfacial stability.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-bwt22?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Artificial Intelligence Chemistry] Accelerated green material and solvent discovery with chemistry- and physics-guided generative AI</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000235?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: Available online 2 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Artificial Intelligence Chemistry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Eslam G.

The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence.  

This perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders. This framework enables a synergistic ecosystem where projects interoperate to accelerate innovation, eliminate duplication, and ensure long-term software sustainability, thereby creating durable foundations that elevate the entire molecular modeling community.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6n5lz?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Tracing Lithophilic Sites: In Situ Nanovisualization of Their Migration and Degradation in All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19144</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c19144/asset/images/medium/ja5c19144_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c19144&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:23:31 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c19144</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Metal−Organic Framework Ion Conductor‐Based Polymer Solid Electrolytes for Long‐Cycle Lithium Batteries</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202511014?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, 2 January 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:53:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202511014</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Regulating Interface Chemistry to Construct a Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Long‐Life Zinc Metal Anodes</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202511310?af=R</link><description>Small, Volume 22, Issue 1, 2 January 2026.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:26:58 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202511310</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

Here we report a full enumeration and computational exploration of this space. Density functional theory-based geometry optimisation and energy calculations have identified all stable molecules within this space, forming a new database called CHX8. A universal strain value has been proposed and assigned to each of these molecules, acting as a proxy for synthesisability and providing a clear guideline of how synthetically plausible these molecules could be. This paper explores the limits of chemical space with CHX8, with a focus on trans-fused, unsaturated and anti-Bredt ring systems. We show that, contrary to prevailing wisdom, most of these unconventional structures should be synthetically accessible, with relative strain energies less than that of cubane. It is expected that this dataset will inspire the synthesis of many new molecules with applications in various areas of chemistry, biology and materials science. The resulting dataset also provides a valuable resource for the development of general and robust machine learning models.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-qjr5r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] A round-robin exercise for the precise prediction of aqueous solubility of organic chemicals using chemometric, machine learning, and stacking ensemble of deep learning models</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Aqueous solubility is an important property for assessing the druggability and ecotoxicological effects of molecules. Successful drug candidates should have optimal aqueous solubility to improve bioavailability to target tissues. To effectively screen molecules in a short period of time, reliable predictive models are highly useful. In the present study, we conducted a round-robin exercise using a large, curated dataset of over 6000 compounds to predict aqueous solubility quantitatively. The six participating groups used an array of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to develop models with strong robustness and external predictive performance. All the models underwent rigorous Leave-One-Out and 10-fold cross-validation. The diversity of training sets and descriptor types used by different groups paved the way for exploring the mechanistic basis for the efficient identification of contributing features. The best-performing model was selected using the statistical Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach, considering the performances on training, cross-validation, and test, as well as the performance difference between the training and test sets. Additionally, a curated, true external set was screened by the six different models. Here, the best-performing model was selected using a consensus ranking strategy based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R_Ext^2. In both approaches, i.e., the inherent model performance in terms of training, test, and cross-validation statistics, and the ability of the model to efficiently predict true external data, the Stacking Ensemble of Deep q-RASPR model emerged as the winner. This model showed comparable predictive performance to the previously reported model, which apparently lacked a proper data curation workflow and contained a significant number of duplicates and mixtures in its dataset, which can inflate model statistics. The insights from the different feature contributions from the different groups identified the useful structural and physicochemical aspects, which can help synthetic chemists to optimize molecules.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2026-6xb6k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Seeing the unseen: Real-time tracking of battery cycling-to-failure via surface strain</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</link><description>This study proposes a strain-based approach to address passive failures in lithium-ion batteries, which present spontaneous safety risks often indistinguishable from routine degradation using conventional diagnostics. By establishing a strain-failure correlation, we introduce a slope-based threshold and a failure-proximity index to characterize degradation-to-failure transitions. Incorporating strain-informed machine learning, it effectively detects early failure onset and estimates proximity. This scalable approach is suitable for real-time, onboard monitoring, supporting safer and more reliable battery operation.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00453-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Understanding and Mitigating Lithium Metal Anode Failure in All-Solid-State Batteries with Inorganic Solid Electrolytes</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333/asset/images/medium/nz5c03333_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 18:39:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03333</guid></item><item><title>[ScienceDirect Publication: Computational Materials Science] Accelerating the search for superconductors using machine learning</title><link>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025625007967?dgcid=rss_sd_all</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Computational Materials Science, Volume 263&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Suhas Adiga, Umesh V.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered fundamental form of magnetic order, distinct from conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. It uniquely exhibits no net magnetization while simultaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry, a combination previously thought to be mutually exclusive. Although its existence and signatures in momentum space have been established, the direct real-space visualization of its defining rotational symmetry breaking has remained a missing cornerstone. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we present atomic-scale imaging of electronic states in the candidate material CsV2Se2O. We directly visualize the hallmark symmetry breaking in the form of unidirectional electronic patterns tied to magnetic domain walls and spin defects, as well as elliptical charging rings surrounding those defects.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of radiation damage in YBa$_2$Cu$3$O${7-\delta}$ (YBCO) is essential for assessing the performance of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes in compact fusion reactors. Existing empirical interatomic potentials have been used to model radiation damage in stoichiometric YBCO, but fail to describe oxygen-deficient compositions, which are ubiquitous in industrial Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide conductors and strongly influence superconducting properties. In this work, we demonstrate that modern machine-learned interatomic potentials enable predictive modelling of radiation damage in YBCO across a wide range of oxygen stoichiometries, with higher fidelity than previous empirical models. We employ two recently developed approaches: an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential and a tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). Both models accurately reproduce Density Functional Theory (DFT) energies, forces, and threshold displacement energy distributions, providing a reliable description of atomic-scale collision processes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 5 keV cascades predict enhanced peak defect production and recombination relative to a widely used empirical potential, indicating different cascade evolution. By explicitly varying oxygen deficiency, we show that total defect production depends only weakly on stoichiometry, offering insight into the robustness of radiation damage processes in oxygen-deficient YBCO. Finally, fusion-relevant 300 keV cascade simulations reveal amorphous regions with dimensions comparable to the superconducting coherence length, consistent with electron microscopy observations of neutron-irradiated HTS tapes. These results establish machine-learned interatomic potentials as efficient and predictive tools for investigating radiation damage in YBCO across relevant compositions and irradiation conditions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24430v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Upscaling from ab initio atomistic simulations to electrode scale: The case of manganese hexacyanoferrate, a cathode material for Na-ion batteries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24816</link><description>arXiv:2512.24816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalizable scale-bridging computational framework that enables predictive modeling of insertion-type electrode materials from atomistic to device scales. Applied to sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, a promising cathode material for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries, our methodology employs an active-learning strategy to train a Moment Tensor Potential through iterative hybrid grand-canonical Monte Carlo--molecular dynamics sampling, robustly capturing configuration spaces at all sodiation levels. The resulting machine learning interatomic potential accurately reproduces experimental properties including volume expansion, operating voltage, and sodium concentration-dependent structural transformations, while revealing a four-order-of-magnitude difference in sodium diffusivity between the rhombohedral (sodium-rich) and tetragonal (sodium-poor) phases at 300 K. We directly compute all critical parameters -- temperature- and concentration-dependent diffusivities, interfacial and strain energies, and complete free-energy landscapes -- to feed them into pseudo-2D phase-field simulations that predict phase-boundary propagation and rate-dependent performances across electrode length scales. This multiscale workflow establishes a blueprint for rational computational design of next-generation insertion-type materials, such as battery electrode materials, demonstrating how atomistic insights can be systematically translated into continuum-scale predictions.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24816v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] SSCHA-based evolutionary crystal structure prediction at finite temperatures with account for quantum nuclear motion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24849</link><description>arXiv:2512.24849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP) at finite temperatures with quantum anharmonic effects remains challenging but very prominent in systems with lightweight atoms such as superconducting hydrides. In this work, we integrate machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) to enable evolutionary CSP on the quantum anharmonic free-energy landscape. Using LaH$_{10}$ at 150 GPa and 300 K as a test case, we compare two approaches for SSCHA-based CSP: using light-weight active-learning MLIPs (AL-MLIPs) trained on-the-fly from scratch, and foundation models or universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) from the Matbench project. We demonstrate that AL-MLIPs allow to correctly predict the experimentally known cubic Fm$\bar{3}$m phase as the most stable polymorph at 150 GPa but require corrections within the thermodynamic perturbation theory to get consistent results. The uMLIP Mattersim-5m allow to conduct SSCHA-based CSP without requiring per-structure training and even get correct structure ranking near the global minimum, though fine-tuning may be needed for higher accuracy. Our results show that including quantum anharmonicity simplifies the free-energy landscape and is essential for correct stability rankings, that is especially important for high-temperature phases that could be missed in classical 0 K CSP. The proposed approach extends the reach of CSP to systems where quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity dominate.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24849v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Large language models and the entropy of English</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969</link><description>arXiv:2512.24969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24969v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Emergence of 3D Superconformal Ising Criticality on the Fuzzy Sphere</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25054</link><description>arXiv:2512.25054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.25054v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Learning Density Functionals to Bridge Particle and Continuum Scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23840</link><description>arXiv:2512.23840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting interfacial thermodynamics across molecular and continuum scales remains a central challenge in computational science. Classical density functional theory (cDFT) provides a first-principles route to connect microscopic interactions with macroscopic observables, but its predictive accuracy depends on approximate free-energy functionals that are difficult to generalize. Here we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that augments cDFT with neural corrections trained directly against molecular-dynamics data through adjoint optimization. Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23840v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CASCADE: Cumulative Agentic Skill Creation through Autonomous Development and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880</link><description>arXiv:2512.23880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23880v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Assessment of First-Principles Methods in Modeling the Melting Properties of Water</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23940</link><description>arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23940v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Testing Noise Correlations by an AI-Assisted Two-Qubit Quantum Sensor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24135</link><description>arXiv:2512.24135v1 Announce Type: cross

Abstract: Floquet engineering offers an unparalleled platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium topological phases. However, the unique structure of Floquet systems, which includes multiple quasienergy gaps, poses a significant challenge to classification using conventional analytical methods. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that employs a kernel defined in momentum-time ($\boldsymbol{k},t$) space, constructed directly from Floquet-Bloch eigenstates. This approach is intrinsically data-driven and requires no prior knowledge of the underlying topological invariants, providing a fundamental advantage over prior methods that rely on abstract concepts like the micromotion operator or homotopic transformations. Crucially, this work successfully reveals the intrinsic topological characteristics encoded within the Floquet eigenstates themselves. We demonstrate that our method robustly and simultaneously identifies the topological invariants associated with both the $0$-gap and the $\pi$-gap across various symmetry classes (1D AIII, 1D D, and 2D A), establishing a robust methodology for the systematic classification and discovery of complex non-equilibrium topological matter.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24822v1</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Dynamic breaking of axial symmetry of acoustic waves in crystals as the origin of nonlinear elasticity and chaos: Analytical model and MD simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04175</link><description>arXiv:2510.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in orientated FCC crystals. A force of dynamic origin is found that is perpendicular to the direction of the external shear pressure. It is proportional to the square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in the motion of atoms. We provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic 3D potential for interaction between crystallographic layers. The potential is found to possess a component that has an anharmonic threefold axial symmetry around one direction. It reduces to the H{\'e}non-Heinen potential in a 2D cross-section, leading to mathematically rich, complex dynamic features. Results of simulation predict displacements of atoms that are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity that may have been overlooked in experiments.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.04175v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link><description>arXiv:2510.18325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it produces compact equations that surpass state-of-the-art black-box models and symbolic regressors, improving $R^2$ by $4 \sim 40$ %. The resulting expressions reveal physical insights, for example, into oxygen-ion transport through coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18325v4</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] Thermodynamic Phase Stability, Structural, Mechanical, Optoelectronic, and Thermoelectric Properties of the III-V Semiconductor AlSb for Energy Conversion Applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22277</link><description>arXiv:2512.22277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.22277v2</guid></item><item><title>[cond-mat updates on arXiv.org] CrystalDiT: A Diffusion Transformer for Crystal Generation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16614</link><description>arXiv:2508.16614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 8.78% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.21%) and MatterGen (3.66%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</description><author>cond-mat updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.16614v3</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Machine Learning‐Augmented Piezoelectric‐Ferroelectret Nanogenerators for Highly Sensitive Respiration Monitoring in Wearable Healthcare</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202522897?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:25:09 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202522897</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents] Ultralong‐Cycling‐Life Sodium Metal Capacitors Enabled by Hetero‐Salt Additive Strategy with NaF/LiF Hybrid Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title><link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202525494?af=R</link><description>Advanced Functional Materials, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Advanced Functional Materials: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:54:32 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/adfm.202525494</guid></item><item><title>[ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Challenges in Transitioning from Pellet to Practical Argyrodite-Based All-Solid-State Batteries</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368/asset/images/medium/nz5c03368_0004.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Energy Letters&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>ACS Energy Letters: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:54:38 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c03368</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents] Machine Learning–Guided Solvation Engineering of Chiral Viologens for Durable Neutral Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202522442?af=R</link><description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Angewandte Chemie International Edition: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:56:15 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/anie.202522442</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Communications] Domain oriented universal machine learning potential enables fast exploration of chemical space of battery electrolytes</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67982-0</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Communications, Published online: 31 December 2025; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67982-0"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67982-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Efficient modeling of battery electrolytes is limited by the accuracy-cost trade-off.

and conversion systems and have become a better choice to generate green hydrogen than their proton 
exchange membrane counterparts owing to the non-acidic working conditions as well as the use of nonprecious metal catalytic electrodes. Albeit the safe operating conditions as well as the use of non-precious 
metals, the ion conductivity and technology readiness level of AEMs are significantly lower than their PEM 
counterparts. It is well accepted that the key factors that drive their performance are anion conductivity, 
water uptake and chemical stability. However, there exist several other parameters that influence not 
only the KPI’s but also the overall electrochemical performance of AEMs. The objective of this study is to 
compile the various physical processes in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser and focus on 
the dominant ones that define the performance of these membranes. We further propose appropriate 
methods to predict the KPIs using multiscale approach. In this report, we elaborately discuss the abovementioned points with a note that, this area still requires substantial research and profound 
understanding from both experimental and computational point of view. In this article, a comprehensive 
review on molecular dynamics simulation methods for anion exchange membranes is extensively 
discussed. We also briefly touch upon the data analytics-based approaches to predict ion conductivity in these

The high diversity of the Aβ family provides a significant challenge for recognizing various Aβ forms, which may differ by a single amino acid or a post-translational modification. Such variation at the N-terminus of Aβ peptides leads to changes in their properties associated with typical AD biomolecular mechanisms, such as aggregation or generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, a novel method for discriminating Aβ peptides with physiologically occurring truncations and modifications at their N-termini, based on the electrochemical profiling of their Cu(II) complexes, is presented. A dual-electrode set-up incorporating both glassy carbon and gold electrodes, together with Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV), was employed to generate unique electrochemical profiles, which were subsequently analyzed using chemometric techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data exploration, and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) for classification. By combining electrochemical measurements with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, we successfully differentiated the studied Aβ forms, Aβ1-16, Aβ3-16, Aβpyr3-16, Aβ4-16, Aβ5-16, Aβ11-16, and Aβpyr11-16. The integration of machine learning not only enhances detection accuracy but also identifies subtle patterns that could support early-stage diagnostics. These findings support the ongoing development of analytical strategies that seek to improve the detection range and accuracy of Aβ peptides identification in Alzheimer’s disease research.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-j5v38?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Sensing the Acidity of Hydrogen Bond Networks</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>The reactivity of hydrogen bond networks (HBNs) is critical to many chemical and biological scenarios. When the HBNs are under constraint, hydrogen bond strength and acidity are affected significantly. HBNs exhibit cooperativity, where connections formed in one part of the HBN influence its behavior elsewhere. We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry. These results enable the engineering and measurement of HBNs in confined environments with tailored acidity.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-twv66?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Thiol-bearing tertiary alkylammonium chloride for regulation of PbI2 excess in FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>One of the key strategies for record photovoltaic efficiencies in metal halide perovskite solar cells is the addition of PbI2 excess in a stoichiometric perovskite solution which controls crystallization, passivates defects and induces a preferred orientation in the perovskite layer. However, residual PbI2, typically found in the perovskite layer after crystallization, generates non-radiative recombination centres and promotes ion migration under light and heating stress, thus accelerating performance loss. To mitigate the above issues, a common strategy is the post-deposition of organic ammonium salts which interact in situ with residual PbI2. Here, we adopt a multifunctional alkylammonium salt, 2-diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride (DEAET), in which both the thiol (–SH) and protonated tertiary amine groups can strongly bind to PbI₂. Upon deposition of DEAET on top of FAPbI3 film, we show that DEAT decreases the percentage of residual PbI2 by 40% and totally eliminates Pb0. These two effects lead to enhanced radiative recombination, proving a net passivation effect, while chemical analysis (FTIR and liquid-state NMR) explains that this is due to strong interactions between tertiary protonated ammonium (-NH+) and thiol (-SH) groups of DEAT with under-coordinated Pb2+. The stabilization of FAPbI3 black phase along with the establishment of a solid barrier to impede the infiltration of moisture into the perovskite layer over time lead to enhanced operational stability for the as-fabricated solar cells. The encouraging findings of this study lay the foundation for the utilization of tertiary ammonium thiol-based salts as efficient agents for interface engineering in perovskite solar cells.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-0wscb-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] LAMMPS-ANI: Large Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations

in-depth performance profiling, and advanced GPU performance optimizations. Our benchmarks show
that ANI is 30 to 60 times faster than the state-of-the-art Allegro Model, emphasizing its speed and

benchmark results for water boxes (up to 100 million atoms) and a solvated HIV capsid (44 million

In this work, the phonon dynamics, carrier transport, and TE performance of the layered SmZnSbO compound are comprehensively evaluated using first-principles calculations, machine learning interatomic potentials, Boltzmann transport theory, and the two-channel model. The coexistence of weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, robust intralayer covalent bonding interactions, and rattling-like vibrations of Zn atoms synergistically induces significant lattice anharmonicity, resulting in a decreased lattice thermal conductivity (0.84 W/mK@900 K within the framework of the two-channel model) for the SmZnSbO compound. The natural quantum well architecture formed by the alternative conductive [Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; layer and the insulated [Sm&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; layer endows quasi-two-dimensional transport characteristics, enabling a high carrier mobility of 34.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs. Moreover, the multi-valley electronic band structure with an indirect bandgap of 0.80 eV simultaneously optimizes electrical conductivity (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;σ&lt;/span&gt;) and Seebeck coefficient (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;), resulting in an enhanced power factor. Benefiting from these synergistic features, the layered SmZnSbO compound achieves optimal dimensionless figures of merit (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ZT&lt;/span&gt;s) of 1.47 and 1.40 for the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;-type and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;-type doping circumstances at 900 K.

Routine alcohol-based cleaning can be impractical on high-touch optical surfaces due to damage risk and usability concerns. Here, we present a scalable approach to transparent, mechanically robust glass surfaces by embedding materials with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;ad hoc&lt;/span&gt; functionality into surface glass nanoholes. We demonstrate the concept with copper nanodisks: copper is an established antimicrobial agent, but its wear susceptibility pose challenges for use on transparent displays. Our design shields the functional material from lateral wear while allowing ion diffusion for antimicrobial efficacy. Fabrication uses only wafer-compatible, lithography-free steps: thermal dewetting of a thin silver film to create a nanosized mask; inverting it to a polymer nanoholes mask by etching the silver nanoparticles; wet etching of the glass to form nanoholes; selective copper deposition inside these holes; and liftoff of excess material. The resulting surfaces exhibit mean transmission of 80%–85% in the 380–750 nm range with haze &amp;lt;1% and minimal color shift, compared to uncoated glass. Antimicrobial efficacy, assessed against &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/span&gt; OP50 under a modified U.S. EPA protocol, shows ≈99% bacterial reduction within one hour. Abrasion tests with a crockmeter simulating finger swipes confirm that the embedded copper remains intact, with no measurable change in optical performance. This embedded design provides a scalable route to integrate antimicrobial functionality into high-touch transparent systems while preserving optical clarity and wear resistance, with potential relevance for medical, consumer, and transportation interfaces.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Materials Current Issue</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apm/article/13/12/121112/3375772/Lithography-free-fabrication-of-transparent</guid></item><item><title>[ChemRxiv] Augmenting Large Language Models for Automated Discovery of f-Element Extractants</title><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</link><description>Efficient separation of f-elements is a critical challenge for a wide range of emerging technologies. The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to propose new ligands and preliminarily rank their performance using a supervised machine learning model trained on experimental datasets to consider the impact of realistic experimental conditions. Promising human-approved ligands are then passed to a second automated pipeline that constructs three-dimensional metal-ligand complexes and performs quantum mechanical free energy calculations to directly assess metal selectivity. We demonstrate this approach for Am(III)/Eu(III) separations and report several newly designed ligands predicted to exhibit higher Am(III)/Eu(III) selectivity than the benchmark extractant CyMe4BTBP. This workflow accelerates computational exploration of the molecular space in this data-sparse field and provides a general strategy for the rapid generation and evaluation of novel lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) extractants.</description><author>ChemRxiv</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Chem.

While recent advances in robotic droplet imaging have facilitated the collection of such datasets, experimental acquisition remains a key bottleneck. Here, we explore whether synthetic image generation can supplement or replace real data in the context of salt classification. Using Stable Diffusion with low-rank adaptation, we generate 133 000 synthetic images from as few as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 1–128 experimental images per salt across seven common inorganic solutes. Synthetic images become visually indistinguishable from real ones for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; ≥ 6; however, quantitative analysis based on 47 image metrics reveals subtle differences that vanish around &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 128. When used to train random forest, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models, synthetic data alone achieve classification accuracies of up to 90% in some low-data regimes. Synthetic augmentation offers a powerful strategy for expanding training sets and enabling image-based chemical classification in data-scarce scenarios, even if it seldom outperforms models trained on real data. The realism of synthetic images also highlights the growing need for tools that detect AI-generated scientific images to ensure data integrity.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046112/3375778/Synthetic-images-from-generative-AI-for</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Effectiveness of Low-Dose Methylprednisolone in Treating Long COVID: A Retrospective Study</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</link><description>Long COVID is a chronic, multisystem disease with limited response to conventional treatments. While low-dose methylprednisolone has shown effectiveness in some patients, individual responses vary, and accurate predictive tools are lacking. This retrospective study included 330 Long COVID patients who received low-dose methylprednisolone treatment across three hospitals. Patients were divided into training (n=202), test (n=33), and external validation sets (n=53, n=42). Using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, 38 variables were analyzed to develop six machine learning models.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02835-4?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] River plastic hotspot detection from space</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02831-7?rss=yes</link><description>Plastic pollution threatens terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and rivers play a central role in transporting and retaining plastics across landscapes. Effective mitigation requires scalable methods to identify riverine plastic accumulation hotspots. Here, we present a semi-automated, cloud-based pipeline that integrates satellite remote sensing and machine learning to detect river plastic hotspots. High-resolution PlanetScope imagery is used to annotate training regions, which are transferred to Sentinel-2 multispectral data to train Random Forest classifiers within Google Earth

However, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ( κ) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs), including recently developed foundation models. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and HIPHIVE against density functional theory and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on  κ. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

This approach identified 12 discriminatory metabolites, with succinate showing a stepwise increase from health to sepsis to SAE and associations with clinical severity scores.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02781-6?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] Interpreting X-ray Diffraction Patterns of Metal–Organic Frameworks via Generative Artificial Intelligence</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c16416/asset/images/medium/ja5c16416_0007.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c16416&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:03:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c16416</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)] [ASAP] A Transformative Molecular Muscle Solid Electrolyte</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18427</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="TOC Graphic" src="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/jacs.5c18427/asset/images/medium/ja5c18427_0006.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5c18427&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>Journal of the American Chemical Society: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:12:03 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c18427</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small Structures: Table of Contents] Li6−xFe1−xAlxCl8 Solid Electrolytes for Cost‐Effective All‐Solid‐State LiFePO4 Batteries</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sstr.202500728?af=R</link><description>Small Structures, EarlyView.</description><author>Wiley: Small Structures: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 18:40:34 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/sstr.202500728</guid></item><item><title>[Joule] Boosting ionic conductivity of fluoride electrolytes by polyanion coordination chemistry enabling 5 V-Class all-solid-state batteries</title><link>https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00414-3?rss=yes</link><description>This study developed a novel class of highly conductive amorphous fluoride solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) LixTi(PO4)x/3F4, using a polyanion coordination strategy. The optimized Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4 achieves a Li+ conductivity of 1.16 × 10−5 S cm−1, two orders of magnitude higher than that of analogous Li2TiF6. Combining the inherent high-voltage stability of fluoride and the excellent ionic conductivity of Li1.3Ti(PO4)1.3/3F4, this material enables superior 5 V-class all-solid-state battery performance. This work opens a new avenue for designing high-conductivity fluoride SSEs and advancing the performance of 5 V-class all-solid-state batteries.</description><author>Joule</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(25)00414-3?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Adsorb-Agent: autonomous identification of stable adsorption configurations via a large language model agent</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00298B</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00298B" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00298B, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Janghoon Ock, Radheesh Sharma Meda, Tirtha Vinchurkar, Yayati Jadhav, Amir Barati Farimani&lt;br /&gt;Adsorb-Agent: an LLM-powered agent for determining the most stable adsorption configurations using reasoning and prior knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00298B</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles in Phys.

This study investigates the factors that make some odors more evocative than others. We examined odor-evoked episodic memory in 106 participants who experienced odors embedded in distinct visuospatial contexts, and whose memory was tested 24–72 hours later. The protocol empirically dissociates odor recognition (“I’ve already smelled this scent”) and associative memory (“It evokes a memory”) processes. Using machine learning with SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identified distinct predictors for each process.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02728-2?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Combining DNA Methylation Features and Clinical Characteristics Predicts Ketamine Treatment Response for PTSD</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02706-3?rss=yes</link><description>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibits extensive clinical and biological variability, making treatment challenging.

The cryo-state preserves metastable SEI components, such as LiPOxFy, which decompose into stable products, such as LiF, with gas release upon warming. Discussions highlight critical XPS conditions, including ultrahigh vacuum exposure, X-ray-induced damage, and neutralizer settings, which could alter the detection and characterization of SEI components.</description><author>Chem</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(25)00428-0?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Deep learning based SEM image analysis for predicting ionic conductivity in LiZr2(PO4)3-based solid electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00232J" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00232J, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kento Murakami, Yudai Yamaguchi, Yo Kato, Kazuki Ishikawa, Naoto Tanibata, Hayami Takeda, Masanobu Nakayama, Masayuki Karasuyama&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-ion-conductive oxide materials have attracted considerable attention as solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00232J</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] Hierarchical Attention Graph Learning with LLMs Enhancement for Molecular Solubility Prediction</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2025/DD/D5DD00407A</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2025, Accepted Manuscript&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00407A, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yangxin Fan, Yinghui  Wu, Roger French, Danny Perez, Michael Taylor, Ping Yang&lt;br /&gt;Solubility quantifies the concentration of a molecule that can dissolve in a given solvent.

Historically, manual inspections have been plagued by subjectivity, inefficiency, and restricted scalability, necessitating the development of enhanced detection algorithms. This research introduces a novel approach utilizing image processing and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy and practical applicability. This strategy promotes classification stability by integrating machine learning classifiers, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, with fusion techniques such as Majority Voting and Mean Fusion. The experiments utilize Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for model evaluation to address dataset variability and deliver thorough assessments. The study’s results indicate that the suggested system surpasses existing systems in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, attaining an overall accuracy of 98.17%. The method is effective across various noise and resolution parameters, allowing for scalability in precision agriculture applications. This discovery not only enhances the diagnosis of plant nutrient deficiencies but also enables further investigations into real-time plant health monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;</description><author>APL Machine Learning Current Issue</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://pubs.aip.org/aip/aml/article/3/4/046111/3374702/Smart-detection-of-plant-nutrient-deficiencies</guid></item><item><title>[RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles] PEMD: a high-throughput simulation and analysis framework for solid polymer electrolytes</title><link>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="center" src="http://pubs.rsc.org/services/images/RSCpubs.ePlatform.Service.FreeContent.ImageService.svc/ImageService/image/GA?id=D5DD00454C" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Discovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, 2026, Advance Article&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOI&lt;/b&gt;: 10.1039/D5DD00454C, Paper&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="Open Access" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/open_access_blue.png" /&gt; Open Access&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt; &lt;img alt="Creative Commons Licence" border="none" src="http://sod-a.rsc-cdn.org/pubs.rsc-uat.org/content/NewImages/CCBY-NC.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This article is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license" target="_blank" title="This link will open in a new browser window"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported Licence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shendong Tan, Bochun Liang, Dexin Lu, Chaoyuan Ji, Wenke Ji, Zihui Li, Tingzheng Hou&lt;br /&gt;PEMD is an open-source Python framework that integrates polymer construction, force-field parameterization, multiscale simulation, and property analysis, with standardized workflows for screening and data-driven design of solid polymer electrolytes.&lt;br /&gt;To cite this article before page numbers are assigned, use the DOI form of citation above.&lt;br /&gt;The content of this RSS Feed (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/div&gt;</description><author>RSC - Digital Discovery latest articles</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2026/DD/D5DD00454C</guid></item><item><title>[AI for Science - latest papers] Investigating CO adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) surfaces using machine learning exchange-correlation functionals</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</link><description>The ‘CO adsorption puzzle’, a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations in density functional theory to replicate CO’s experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn–Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06, and can be applied to study unseen adsorbate coverages. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description><author>AI for Science - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/3050-287X/ae21fa</guid></item><item><title>[iScience] Consensus machine learning identifies cell death gene signature for carotid artery stenosis diagnosis</title><link>https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02658-6?rss=yes</link><description>Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is a major contributor to ischemic stroke, and molecular tools for its early detection remain limited.

Yet the link between sensorimotor recalibration to new physical conditions and cognitive updating of internal models remains unclear. We addressed this using altered gravity as a model system. In a within-subject study, 25 adults completed a virtual-reality task requiring motor adjustment to non-terrestrial gravities and an online problem-solving task requiring physical reasoning under matched gravity manipulations. Adaptability in each domain was computed relative to performance under terrestrial gravity.</description><author>iScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(25)02604-5?rss=yes</guid></item><item><title>[Wiley: Small: Table of Contents] Label‐Free Detection of Nuclear Envelope Nucleoporation using 2D Morphological Embeddings and Machine Learning</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202504402?af=R</link><description>Small, Volume 21, Issue 48, December 3, 2025.</description><author>Wiley: Small: Table of Contents</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:24:49 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">10.1002/smll.202504402</guid></item></channel></rss>
